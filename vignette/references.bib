  abstract  = "The intracellular levels of many proteins are regulated by
               ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. One of the best-characterized
               enzymes that catalyzes the attachment of ubiquitin to proteins
               is a ubiquitin ligase complex, Skp1-Cullin-F box complex
               containing Hrt1 (SCF). We sought to artificially target a
               protein to the SCF complex for ubiquitination and degradation.
               To this end, we tested methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2),
               which covalently binds the angiogenesis inhibitor ovalicin. A
               chimeric compound, protein-targeting chimeric molecule 1
               (Protac-1), was synthesized to recruit MetAP-2 to SCF. One
               domain of Protac-1 contains the I$\kappa$B$\alpha$
               phosphopeptide that is recognized by the F-box protein
               $\beta$-TRCP, whereas the other domain is composed of ovalicin.
               We show that MetAP-2 can be tethered to SCF$\beta$-TRCP,
               ubiquitinated, and degraded in a Protac-1-dependent manner. In
               the future, this approach may be useful for conditional
               inactivation of proteins, and for targeting disease-causing
               proteins for destruction. * E1, : ubiquitin-activating enzymes;

              hybridization, SNP arrays and DNA sequencing platforms. Many
              techniques are available for detecting recurring aberrations
              across multiple tumor samples, including CMAR, STAC, GISTIC and
              KC-SMART. GISTIC is widely used and detects both broad and focal
              (potentially overlapping) recurring events. However, GISTIC
              performs false discovery rate control on probes instead of
              events. Here we propose Analytical Multi-scale Identification of
              Recurrent Events, a multi-scale Gaussian smoothing approach, for
              the detection of both broad and focal (potentially overlapping)

              segmentation or calling on the input dataset and therefore
              reduces the potential loss of information due to discretization.
              An important characteristic of the approach is that the error
              rate is controlled across all scales and that the algorithm
              outputs a single profile of significant events selected from the
              appropriate scales. We perform extensive simulations and showcase
              its utility on a glioblastoma SNP array dataset. Importantly,

              A key feature of GBMs is the extensive network of abnormal
              vasculature characterized by glomeruloid structures and
              endothelial hyperplasia. Yet the mechanisms of angiogenesis and
              the origin of tumour endothelial cells remain poorly defined.
              Here we demonstrate that a subpopulation of endothelial cells
              within glioblastomas harbour the same somatic mutations
              identified within tumour cells, such as amplification of EGFR and
              chromosome 7. We additionally demonstrate that the stem-cell-like
              CD133(+) fraction includes a subset of vascular
              endothelial-cadherin (CD144)-expressing cells that show
              characteristics of endothelial progenitors capable of maturation
              into endothelial cells. Extensive in vitro and in vivo lineage
              analyses, including single cell clonal studies, further show that
              a subpopulation of the CD133(+) stem-like cell fraction is
              multipotent and capable of differentiation along tumour and
              endothelial lineages, possibly via an intermediate
              CD133(+)/CD144(+) progenitor cell. The findings are supported by
              genetic studies of specific exons selected from The Cancer Genome
              Atlas, quantitative FISH and comparative genomic hybridization
              data that demonstrate identical genomic profiles in the CD133(+)
              tumour cells, their endothelial progenitor derivatives and mature
              endothelium. Exposure to the clinical anti-angiogenesis agent
              bevacizumab or to a $\gamma$-secretase inhibitor as well as
              knockdown shRNA studies demonstrate that blocking VEGF or
              silencing VEGFR2 inhibits the maturation of tumour endothelial
              progenitors into endothelium but not the differentiation of
              CD133(+) cells into endothelial progenitors, whereas
              $\gamma$-secretase inhibition or NOTCH1 silencing blocks the
              transition into endothelial progenitors. These data may provide
              new perspectives on the mechanisms of failure of
              anti-angiogenesis inhibitors currently in use. The lineage

              common primary malignant brain tumors, with an annual incidence
              of 5.26 per 100,000 population or 17,000 new diagnoses per year.
              These tumors are typically associated with a dismal prognosis and
              poor quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical
              management of malignant gliomas, including genetic and
              environmental risk factors such as cell phones, diagnostic
              pitfalls, symptom management, specific antitumor therapy, and
              common complications. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Search of PubMed
              references from January 2000 to May 2013 using the terms
              glioblastoma, glioma, malignant glioma, anaplastic astrocytoma,
              anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and
              brain neoplasm. Articles were also identified through searches of
              the authors' own files. Evidence was graded using the American
              Heart Association classification system. FINDINGS: Only radiation
              exposure and certain genetic syndromes are well-defined risk
              factors for malignant glioma. The treatment of newly diagnosed
              glioblastoma is based on radiotherapy combined with temozolomide.
              This approach doubles the 2-year survival rate to 27\%, but
              overall prognosis remains poor. Bevacizumab is an emerging
              treatment alternative that deserves further study. Grade III
              tumors have been less well studied, and clinical trials to
              establish standards of care are ongoing. Patients with malignant
              gliomas experience frequent clinical complications, including
              thromboembolic events, seizures, fluctuations in neurologic
              symptoms, and adverse effects from corticosteroids and
              chemotherapies that require proper management and prophylaxis.
              CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Glioblastoma remains a difficult
              cancer to treat, although therapeutic options have been
              improving. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary

              Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of
              large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular
              characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly
              to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative
              analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation
              aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult
              brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the
              206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the
              roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the
              phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1,
              and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the
              development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of
              mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a
              link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator
              phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated
              glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical
              implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility
              and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand
              knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.",

              individual's risk for heritable disease remains difficult. Large
              numbers of mapped loci do not explain substantial fractions of
              heritable variation, leaving an open question of whether accurate
              complex trait predictions can be achieved in practice. Here, we
              use a genome sequenced population of ∼7,000 yeast strains of high
              but varying relatedness, and predict growth traits from family
              information, effects of segregating genetic variants and growth
              in other environments with an average coefficient of
              determination R(2) of 0.91. This accuracy exceeds narrow-sense
              heritability, approaches limits imposed by measurement
              repeatability and is higher than achieved with a single assay in
              the laboratory. Our results prove that very accurate prediction

              active compounds against a panel of genomically heterogeneous
              cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple relationships between
              genomic alterations and drug responses. Various computational

              genomic features, while others have used the chemical properties
              of the drugs to ascertain their effect. In an effort to integrate
              these complementary approaches, we developed machine learning
              models to predict the response of cancer cell lines to drug
              treatment, quantified through IC₅₀ values, based on both the
              genomic features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of
              the considered drugs. Models predicted IC₅₀ values in a 8-fold
              cross-validation and an independent blind test with coefficient
              of determination R² of 0.72 and 0.64 respectively. Furthermore,

              The implications of our results go beyond virtual drug screening

              used in human cell lines; however, the features of effective
              guide RNAs (gRNAs) in different organisms have not been well
              characterized. Here, we define rules that determine gRNA
              effectiveness for transcriptional repression in Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae. RESULTS: We create an inducible single plasmid
              CRISPRi system for gene repression in yeast, and use it to
              analyze fitness effects of gRNAs under 18 small molecule
              treatments. Our approach correctly identifies previously
              described chemical-genetic interactions, as well as a new
              mechanism of suppressing fluconazole toxicity by repression of
              the ERG25 gene. Assessment of multiple target loci across
              treatments using gRNA libraries allows us to determine
              generalizable features associated with gRNA efficacy. Guides that
              target regions with low nucleosome occupancy and high chromatin
              accessibility are clearly more effective. We also find that the
              best region to target gRNAs is between the transcription start
              site (TSS) and 200 bp upstream of the TSS. Finally, unlike
              nuclease-proficient Cas9 in human cells, the specificity of
              truncated gRNAs (18 nt of complementarity to the target) is not
              clearly superior to full-length gRNAs (20 nt of complementarity),
              as truncated gRNAs are generally less potent against both
              mismatched and perfectly matched targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results establish a powerful functional and chemical genomics
              screening method and provide guidelines for designing effective
              gRNAs, which consider chromatin state and position relative to
              the target gene TSS. These findings will enable effective library

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Studying combinatorial patterns in cancer genomic
              datasets has recently emerged as a tool for identifying novel
              cancer driver networks. Approaches have been devised to quantify,
              for example, the tendency of a set of genes to be mutated in a
              'mutually exclusive' manner. The significance of the proposed
              metrics is usually evaluated by computing P-values under
              appropriate null models. To this end, a Monte Carlo method (the
              switching-algorithm) is used to sample simulated datasets under a
              null model that preserves patient- and gene-wise mutation rates.
              In this method, a genomic dataset is represented as a bipartite
              network, to which Markov chain updates (switching-steps) are
              applied. These steps modify the network topology, and a minimal
              number of them must be executed to draw simulated datasets
              independently under the null model. This number has previously
              been deducted empirically to be a linear function of the total
              number of variants, making this process computationally
              expensive. RESULTS: We present a novel approximate lower bound
              for the number of switching-steps, derived analytically.
              Additionally, we have developed the R package BiRewire, including
              new efficient implementations of the switching-algorithm. We
              illustrate the performances of BiRewire by applying it to large
              real cancer genomics datasets. We report vast reductions in time
              requirement, with respect to existing implementations/bounds and

              study statistical properties in genomic datasets, and other data
              that can be modeled as bipartite networks. AVAILABILITY AND

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Networks are popular and powerful tools to describe
              and model biological processes. Many computational methods have
              been developed to infer biological networks from literature,
              high-throughput experiments, and combinations of both.
              Additionally, a wide range of tools has been developed to map
              experimental data onto reference biological networks, in order to
              extract meaningful modules. Many of these methods assess results'
              significance against null distributions of randomized networks.
              However, these standard unconstrained randomizations do not
              preserve the functional characterization of the nodes in the
              reference networks (i.e. their degrees and connection signs),
              hence including potential biases in the assessment. RESULTS:
              Building on our previous work about rewiring bipartite networks,
              we propose a method for rewiring any type of unweighted networks.
              In particular we formally demonstrate that the problem of
              rewiring a signed and directed network preserving its functional
              connectivity (F-rewiring) reduces to the problem of rewiring two
              induced bipartite networks. Additionally, we reformulate the
              lower bound to the iterations' number of the switching-algorithm
              to make it suitable for the F-rewiring of networks of any size.
              Finally, we present BiRewire3, an open-source Bioconductor
              package enabling the F-rewiring of any type of unweighted
              network. We illustrate its application to a case study about the
              identification of modules from gene expression data mapped on
              protein interaction networks, and a second one focused on
              building logic models from more complex signed-directed reference
              signaling networks and phosphoproteomic data. CONCLUSIONS:
              BiRewire3 it is freely available at
              https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/BiRewire/ , and it should
              have a broad application as it allows an efficient and

              Pooled libraries of CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting human
              protein-coding genes and encoded in viral vectors have been used
              to systematically create gene knockouts in a variety of human
              cancer and immortalized cell lines, in an effort to identify
              whether these knockouts cause cellular fitness defects. Previous
              work has shown that CRISPR screens are more sensitive and

              this subject, we characterised the landscape of pathway
              alterations associated with somatic mutations observed in 4,415
              patients across ten cancer types, using 374 orthogonal pathway
              gene-sets mapped onto canonical cancer hallmarks. Towards this

              population-level statistics, freely available as an open source R
              package. Assembling the identified pathway alterations into sets
              of hallmark signatures allowed us to connect somatic mutations to
              clinically interpretable cancer mechanisms. Further, we explored
              the heterogeneity of these signatures, in terms of ratio of

              specific cancer types, thus suggesting different evolutionary
              trajectories across cancer lineages. Finally, although many

              databases, using phylogenetic trees to extrapolate from the
              relatively sparse experimental information from a few model

              represent gene family evolution, including inference of
              evolutionary events, such as speciation and gene duplication.

              ontology functional annotations can now be made at any node in

              analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
              terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order

              involved in making a release, thereby permitting more frequent
              releases. Arguably the most significant of these changes is that
              Pfam is now primarily based on the UniProtKB reference proteomes,
              with the counts of matched sequences and species reported on the
              website restricted to this smaller set. Building families on
              reference proteomes sequences brings greater stability, which
              decreases the amount of manual curation required to maintain
              them. It also reduces the number of sequences displayed on the
              website, whilst still providing access to many important model
              organisms. Matches to the full UniProtKB database are, however,
              still available and Pfam annotations for individual UniProtKB

              oncology, enabling the identification of genomic alterations in

              with advanced cancer who underwent testing on a genomic testing
              protocol, including the frequency of actionable alterations
              across tumor types, subsequent enrollment onto clinical trials,
              and the challenges for trial enrollment. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
              Standardized hotspot mutation analysis was performed in 2,000
              patients, using either an 11-gene (251 patients) or a 46- or
              50-gene (1,749 patients) multiplex platform. Thirty-five genes
              were considered potentially actionable based on their potential
              to be targeted with approved or investigational therapies.
              RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-nine patients (39\%) had at least
              one mutation in potentially actionable genes. Eighty-three
              patients (11\%) with potentially actionable mutations went on
              genotype-matched trials targeting these alterations. Of 230
              patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN/BRAF mutations that returned for
              therapy, 116 (50\%) received a genotype-matched drug. Forty
              patients (17\%) were treated on a genotype-selected trial
              requiring a mutation for eligibility, 16 (7\%) were treated on a
              genotype-relevant trial targeting a genomic alteration without
              biomarker selection, and 40 (17\%) received a genotype-relevant
              drug off trial. Challenges to trial accrual included patient
              preference of noninvestigational treatment or local treatment,
              poor performance status or other reasons for trial ineligibility,
              lack of trials/slots, and insurance denial. CONCLUSION: Broad
              implementation of multiplex hotspot testing is feasible; however,
              only a small portion of patients with actionable alterations were
              actually enrolled onto genotype-matched trials. Increased
              awareness of therapeutic implications and access to novel
              therapeutics are needed to optimally leverage results from
              broad-based genomic testing.",

              pool constitutes a reservoir from which drug-resistant tumours

              limiting their effectiveness. A high-mesenchymal cell state
              observed in human tumours and cancer cell lines has been
              associated with resistance to multiple treatment modalities
              across diverse cancer lineages, but the mechanistic underpinning
              for this state has remained incompletely understood. Here we
              molecularly characterize this therapy-resistant high-mesenchymal
              cell state in human cancer cell lines and organoids and show that
              it depends on a druggable lipid-peroxidase pathway that protects
              against ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced
              by the build-up of toxic lipid peroxides. We show that this cell
              state is characterized by activity of enzymes that promote the
              synthesis of polyunsaturated lipids. These lipids are the
              substrates for lipid peroxidation by lipoxygenase enzymes. This
              lipid metabolism creates a dependency on pathways converging on
              the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), a
              selenocysteine-containing enzyme that dissipates lipid peroxides
              and thereby prevents the iron-mediated reactions of peroxides
              that induce ferroptotic cell death. Dependency on GPX4 was found

  abstract = "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is the molecular fingerprint of
              a deficient mismatch repair system. Approximately 15\% of
              colorectal cancers (CRC) display MSI owing either to epigenetic
              silencing of MLH1 or a germline mutation in one of the mismatch
              repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2. Methods to detect MSI are
              well established and routinely incorporated into clinical
              practice. A clinical and molecular profile of MSI tumors has been
              described, leading to the concept of an MSI phenotype in CRC.
              Studies have confirmed that MSI tumors have a better prognosis
              than microsatellite stable CRC, but MSI cancers do not
              necessarily have the same response to the chemotherapeutic
              strategies used to treat microsatellite stable tumors.
              Specifically, stage II MSI tumors might not benefit from
              5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. New data
              suggest possible advantages of irinotecan-based regimens, but
              these findings require further clarification. Characterization of
              the molecular basis of MSI in CRC is underway and initial results
              show that mutations in genes encoding kinases and candidate genes
              with microsatellite tracts are over-represented in MSI tumors.

              ``non-self'' immunogenic antigens. We hypothesized that tumors
              with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair
              defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.
              METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical
              activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune
              checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic
              carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency.
              Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg
              per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with
              mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with
              mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with
              mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal. The
              coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response
              rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival
              rate. RESULTS: The immune-related objective response rate and
              immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40\% (4 of 10
              patients) and 78\% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch
              repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0\% (0 of 18 patients)
              and 11\% (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient
              colorectal cancers. The median progression-free survival and
              overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch
              repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months,
              respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient
              colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death,
              0.10 [P<0.001], and hazard ratio for death, 0.22 [P=0.05]).
              Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had
              responses similar to those of patients with mismatch
              repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective
              response rate, 71\% [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related
              progression-free survival rate, 67\% [4 of 6 patients]).
              Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations
              per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with
              73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high
              somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged
              progression-free survival (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study

  abstract = "Non-biological experimental variation or ``batch effects'' are
              commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray
              experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from
              these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data
              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch
              effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from
              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch
              sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray
              studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing
              methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and
              non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for
              batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes
              and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We
              illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that

              since the WRN gene (also called RECQL2 or REQ3) was first cloned

  abstract = "Werner syndrome (WS) is a severe recessive disorder characterized
              by premature aging, cancer predisposition and genomic
              instability. The gene mutated in WS encodes a bi-functional
              enzyme called WRN that acts as a RecQ-type DNA helicase and a
              3'-5' exonuclease, but its exact role in DNA metabolism is poorly
              understood. Here we show that WRN physically interacts with the
              MSH2/MSH6 (MutSalpha), MSH2/MSH3 (MutSbeta) and MLH1/PMS2
              (MutLalpha) heterodimers that are involved in the initiation of
              mismatch repair (MMR) and the rejection of homeologous
              recombination. MutSalpha and MutSbeta can strongly stimulate the
              helicase activity of WRN specifically on forked DNA structures
              with a 3'-single-stranded arm. The stimulatory effect of
              MutSalpha on WRN-mediated unwinding is enhanced by a G/T mismatch
              in the DNA duplex ahead of the fork. The MutLalpha protein known
              to bind to the MutS alpha-heteroduplex complexes has no effect on
              WRN-mediated DNA unwinding stimulated by MutSalpha, nor does it
              affect DNA unwinding by WRN alone. Our data are consistent with
              results of genetic experiments in yeast suggesting that MMR

  author   = "Pession, Andrea and Tonelli, Roberto",
  abstract = "MYCN belongs to the MYC family of proto-oncogenes, which encode
              for transcription factors of the basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper
              (bHLHZ) class and is fundamental in the development of the
              peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS and CNS). While Myc
              is ubiquitous, MYCN has a very restricted expression pattern: it
              is mainly expressed during embryonic development, but then
              becomes downregulated, while in adults it is usually detected in
              B-cell development. Identification of selective inhibitors of
              MYCN and its mRNA and protein could be important for the
              development of more specific, effective and less toxic
              therapeutic agents for tumors of the PNS and CNS. In children,
              the most common tumors of the PNS and CNS are neuroblastomas and
              medulloblastomas, respectively. About 30\% of neuroblastoma (NB)
              tumors present MYCN amplification/over-expression, which is
              associated with rapid progression and poor prognosis. N-Myc is
              essential during neurogenesis for the rapid expansion of
              progenitor cells in the brain. MYCN amplification and
              over-expression has been reported in medulloblastoma, and
              especially in the desmoplastic type. Other tumors associated with
              MYCN overexpression include retinoblastoma, small cell lung
              carcinoma, glioblastoma and certain embryonal tumors. A
              cell-based, N-Myc-dependent luciferase reporter gene assay to
              identify specific N-Myc small-molecule inhibitors has allowed
              identification of five compounds showing significant activity.
              Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been shown to inhibit N-Myc
              production and anti-tumoral activity in vitro and in vivo for NB.
              Peptide nucleic acids (PNA), which belong to the most recent
              (third) generation of nucleic acid therapeutics, form highly
              stable duplexes with DNA and RNA, and are resistant to
              degradation by nucleases and proteases. Encouraging results have

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows
              large-scale screening of gene essentiality in cancer. A
              confounding factor when interpreting CRISPR-Cas9 screens is the
              high false-positive rate in detecting essential genes within copy
              number amplified regions of the genome. We have developed the
              computational tool CRISPRcleanR which is capable of identifying
              and correcting gene-independent responses to CRISPR-Cas9
              targeting. CRISPRcleanR uses an unsupervised approach based on
              the segmentation of single-guide RNA fold change values across
              the genome, without making any assumption about the copy number
              status of the targeted genes. RESULTS: Applying our method to
              existing and newly generated genome-wide essentiality profiles
              from 15 cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that CRISPRcleanR
              reduces false positives when calling essential genes, correcting
              biases within and outside of amplified regions, while maintaining
              true positive rates. Established cancer dependencies and
              essentiality signals of amplified cancer driver genes are
              detectable post-correction. CRISPRcleanR reports sgRNA fold
              changes and normalised read counts, is therefore compatible with
              downstream analysis tools, and works with multiple sgRNA
              libraries. CONCLUSIONS: CRISPRcleanR is a versatile open-source
              tool for the analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to identify
              essential genes.",

              molecular features to detect biomarkers of drug
              response.Experimental design: We utilized a high-throughput
              chemical inhibitor screen in a panel of 889 cancer cell lines,
              including both immortalized and primary early-passage
              mesothelioma lines, alongside comprehensive molecular
              characterization using Illumina whole-exome sequencing,
              copy-number analysis and Affymetrix array whole transcriptome
              profiling. Subsequent validation was done using functional assays
              such as siRNA silencing and mesothelioma mouse xenograft
              models.Results: A subgroup of immortalized and primary MPM lines
              appeared highly sensitive to FGFR inhibition. None of these lines
              harbored genomic alterations of FGFR family members, but rather
              BAP1 protein loss was associated with enhanced sensitivity to
              FGFR inhibition. This was confirmed in an MPM mouse xenograft
              model and by BAP1 knockdown and overexpression in cell line
              models. Gene expression analyses revealed an association between
              BAP1 loss and increased expression of the receptors FGFR1/3 and
              ligands FGF9/18. BAP1 loss was associated with activation of MAPK
              signaling. These associations were confirmed in a cohort of MPM
              patient samples.Conclusions: A subgroup of mesotheliomas cell
              lines harbor sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. BAP1 protein loss
              enriches for this subgroup and could serve as a potential
              biomarker to select patients for FGFR inhibitor treatment. These

              strategies for neuronal plasticity and regeneration in neural
              disorders. Fasudil is a clinical medication that is used to treat
              subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and that is beneficial for many
              animal models of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this
              study, we hypothesised that fasudil administration would promote
              neurite outgrowth in neural stem cells (NSCs). METHODS: Changes
              in cell morphology were imaged under a light microscope, and
              neurite-bearing cells were counted. Cell viability and the
              necrosis rate were determined by MTT and LDH assays,
              respectively. Additionally, western blot and immunofluorescence
              analyses were performed to detect protein expression levels.
              RESULTS: We found that fasudil promoted neurite outgrowth in
              C17.2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The
              neurite-bearing C17.2 cells were differentiated by detecting the
              changes in neural and astrocytic markers after fasudil treatment
              through down-regulating Notch signalling. Previously, fasudil was
              reported to induce autophagy, which plays an important role in
              neural differentiation. However, both rapamycin, an autophagy
              inducer, and 3-methyl-adenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, had
              no effects on the fasudil-induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting
              that autophagy may be not involved in this process. CONCLUSION:
              In summary, fasudil could stimulate neurite outgrowth and

              response of multiple human cell lines to a compound of interest
              (namely the seed compound). This signature can be derived from
              data in existing databases, such as the connectivity-map, and it
              is used at first instance to query a network interlinking all the
              connectivity-map compounds, based on the similarity of their
              transcriptional responses. This provides a drug neighbourhood,
              composed of compounds predicted to share some effects with the
              seed one. The original signature is then refined by
              systematically reducing its overlap with the transcriptional
              responses induced by drugs in this neighbourhood that are known
              to share a secondary effect with the seed compound. Finally, the
              drug network is queried again with the resulting refined
              signatures and the whole process is carried on for a number of
              iterations. Drugs in the final refined neighbourhood are then
              predicted to exert the principal mode of action of the seed
              compound. We illustrate our approach using paclitaxel (a
              microtubule stabilising agent) as seed compound. Our method
              predicts that glipizide and splitomicin perturb microtubule

              growth rates and transiently increase the percentage of mitotic
              cells-consistent with our prediction. Finally, we validated the
              refined signatures of paclitaxel response by mining a large drug
              screening dataset, showing that human cancer cell lines whose
              basal transcriptional profile is anti-correlated to them are

              immediate importance to develop novel therapeutics. Human
              ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1/RRM2) has an essential role in
              converting ribonucleoside diphosphate to 2'-deoxyribonucleoside
              diphosphate to maintain the homeostasis of nucleotide pools. RRM2
              is a prognostic biomarker and predicts poor survival of CRC. In
              addition, increased RRM2 activity is associated with malignant
              transformation and tumor cell growth. Bioinformatics analyses
              show that RRM2 was overexpressed in CRC and might be an
              attractive target for treating CRC. Therefore, we attempted to
              search novel RRM2 inhibitors by using a gene expression

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle
              cells (VSMC) is a major cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
              Many studies suggest that vascular injury triggers VSMC
              dedifferentiation, which results in VSMC changes from a
              contractile to a synthetic phenotype; however, the underlying
              molecular mechanisms are still unclear. METHODS: In this study,
              we examined how VSMC responds under mechanical stress by using
              time-course microarray data. A three-phase study was proposed to
              investigate the stress-induced differentially expressed genes
              (DEGs) in VSMC. First, DEGs were identified by using the
              moderated t-statistics test. Second, more DEGs were inferred by
              using the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM). Finally, the
              topological parameters-based method and cluster analysis approach
              were employed to predict the last batch of DEGs. To identify the
              potential drugs for vascular diseases involve VSMC proliferation,
              the drug-gene interaction database, Connectivity Map (cMap) was
              employed. Success of the predictions were determined using
              in-vitro data, i.e. MTT and clonogenic assay. RESULTS: Based on
              the differential expression calculation, at least 23 DEGs were
              found, and the findings were qualified by previous studies on
              VSMC. The results of gene set enrichment analysis indicated that
              the most often found enriched biological processes are
              cell-cycle-related processes. Furthermore, more stress-induced
              genes, well supported by literature, were found by applying graph
              theory to the gene association network (GAN). Finally, we showed
              that by processing the cMap input queries with a cluster
              algorithm, we achieved a substantial increase in the number of
              potential drugs with experimental IC50 measurements. With this
              novel approach, we have not only successfully identified the
              DEGs, but also improved the DEGs prediction by performing the
              topological and cluster analysis. Moreover, the findings are
              remarkably validated and in line with the literature.
              Furthermore, the cMap and DrugBank resources were used to
              identify potential drugs and targeted genes for vascular diseases

              in-vitro experimental IC50, binding activity data and clinical
              trials. CONCLUSION: This study provides a systematic strategy to
              discover potential drugs and target genes, by which we hope to
              shed light on the treatments of VSMC proliferation associated
              diseases.",

              it does not allow for following mechanistically signal
              transduction from one node to the next. To address this important
              issue, we used a directed, signaling network as a scaffold to

              Braf(V618E) (analogous to the human BRAF(V600E) mutation) led to

              insertional mutagenesis in this model led to accelerated and

              Treatment of Braf(V618E) transposon mice with the BRAF inhibitor

  abstract = "All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however,
              understanding of the biological processes generating these
              mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a
              cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes
              that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations
              from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational
              signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a
              signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases,
              whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain
              signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer
              diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA
              maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these
              genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to
              small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types.
              The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes
              underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications
              for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.",

              of DNA helicases. It possesses both 3'-->5' DNA helicase and
              3'-->5' DNA exonuclease activities. Mutations in WRN are causally
              associated with a rare, recessive disorder, Werner syndrome (WS),
              distinguished by premature aging and genomic instability; all are
              reported to result in loss of protein expression. In addition to
              WS-linked mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, with
              frequencies that exceed those of WS-associated mutations, are
              also present in WRN. We have initiated studies to determine if
              six of these polymorphisms affect the enzymatic activities of
              WRN. We show that two common polymorphisms, F1074L and C1367R,

              little change in activity relative to wild-type WRN; the

              activity. However, an infrequent polymorphism, R834C, located in
              the helicase domain dramatically reduces WRN helicase and
              helicase-coupled exonuclease activity. The structure of the E.
              coli helicase core suggests that R834 may be involved in
              interactions with ATP. As predicted, substitution of Arg with Cys
              interferes with ATP hydrolysis that is absolutely required for
              unwinding DNA. R834C thus represents the first missense amino
              acid polymorphism in WRN that nearly abolishes enzymatic activity

  abstract = "The structural and biophysical properties typically associated
              with G-quadruplex (G4) structures render them a significant block
              for DNA replication, which must be overcome for cell division to
              occur. The Werner syndrome protein (WRN) is a RecQ family
              helicase that has been implicated in the efficient processing of
              G4 DNA structures. The aim of this study was to identify the
              residues of WRN involved in the binding and ATPase-driven
              unwinding of G4 DNA. Using a c-Myc G4 DNA model sequence and
              recombinant WRN, we have determined that the RecQ-C-terminal
              (RQC) domain of WRN imparts a 2-fold preference for binding to G4
              DNA relative to non-G4 DNA substrates. NMR studies identified
              residues involved specifically in interactions with G4 DNA. Three
              of the amino acids in the WRN RQC domain that exhibited the
              largest G4-specific changes in NMR signal were then mutated alone
              or in combination. Mutating individual residues implicated in G4
              binding had a modest effect on WRN binding to DNA, decreasing the
              preference for G4 substrates by ∼25\%. Mutating two
              G4-interacting residues (T1024G and T1086G) abrogated
              preferential binding of WRN to G4 DNA. Very modest decreases in
              G4 DNA-stimulated ATPase activity were observed for the mutant
              enzymes. Most strikingly, G4 unwinding by WRN was inhibited ∼50\%
              for all three point mutants and >90\% for the WRN double mutant
              (T1024G/T1086G) relative to normal B-form dsDNA substrates. Our

              and intra-tumoural heterogeneity and detailed characterization of
              in vitro models representing the different histological and
              molecular ovarian cancer subtypes is critical to enable reliable
              preclinical testing. There are approximately 100 publicly
              available ovarian cancer cell lines but their cellular and
              molecular characteristics are largely undescribed. We have
              characterized 39 ovarian cancer cell lines under uniform
              conditions for growth characteristics, mRNA/microRNA expression,
              exon sequencing, drug response for clinically-relevant
              therapeutics and collated all available information on the
              original clinical features and site of origin. We tested for
              statistical associations between the cellular and molecular
              features of the lines and clinical features. Of the 39 ovarian
              cancer cell lines, 14 were assigned as high-grade serous, four
              serous-type, one low-grade serous and 20 non-serous type. Three
              morphological subtypes: Epithelial (n = 21), Round (n = 7) and
              Spindle (n = 12) were identified that showed distinct biological
              and molecular characteristics, including overexpression of cell
              movement and migration-associated genes in the Spindle subtype.
              Comparison with the original clinical data showed association of
              the spindle-like tumours with metastasis, advanced stage,

              by scrutinizing large numbers of scientific publications. Over 4

              combining genome-wide sequencing results from 28 366 tumours with
              complete manual curation of 23 489 individual publications
              focused on 186 key genes and 286 key fusion pairs across all
              cancers. Molecular profiling of large tumour numbers has also
              allowed the annotation of more than 13 million non-coding

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Proper cell models for breast cancer primary tumors
              have long been the focal point in the cancer's research. The
              genomic comparison between cell lines and tumors can investigate
              the similarity and dissimilarity and help to select right cell
              model to mimic tumor tissues to properly evaluate the drug
              reaction in vitro. In this paper, a comprehensive comparison in
              copy number variation (CNV), mutation, mRNA expression and
              protein expression between 68 breast cancer cell lines and 1375
              primary breast tumors is conducted and presented. RESULTS: Using
              whole genome expression arrays, strong correlations were observed
              between cells and tumors. PAM50 gene expression differentiated
              them into four major breast cancer subtypes: Luminal A and B,
              HER2amp, and Basal-like in both cells and tumors partially.
              Genomic CNVs patterns were observed between tumors and cells
              across chromosomes in general. High C > T and C > G trans-version
              rates were observed in both cells and tumors, while the cells had
              slightly higher somatic mutation rates than tumors. Clustering
              analysis on protein expression data can reasonably recover the
              breast cancer subtypes in cell lines and tumors. Although the
              drug-targeted proteins ER/PR and interesting
              mTOR/GSK3/TS2/PDK1/ER\_P118 cluster had shown the consistent
              patterns between cells and tumor, low protein-based correlations
              were observed between cells and tumors. The expression
              consistency of mRNA verse protein between cell line and tumors
              reaches 0.7076. These important drug targets in breast cancer,
              ESR1, PGR, HER2, EGFR and AR have a high similarity in mRNA and
              protein variation in both tumors and cell lines. GATA3 and
              RP56KB1 are two promising drug targets for breast cancer. A total
              score developed from the four correlations among four molecular
              profiles suggests that cell lines, BT483, T47D and MDAMB453 have
              the highest similarity with tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated
              data from across these multiple platforms demonstrates the
              existence of the similarity and dissimilarity of molecular
              features between breast cancer tumors and cell lines. The cell
              lines only mirror some but not all of the molecular properties of
              primary tumors. The study results add more evidence in selecting
              cell line models for breast cancer research.",

              the genetic diversity of primary cancers is uncertain. In this
              study, we profiled 70 colorectal cancer cell lines for mutations
              and DNA copy number by whole-exome sequencing and SNP microarray
              analyses, respectively. Gene expression was defined using
              RNA-Seq. Cell line data were compared with those published for
              primary colorectal cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Notably,
              we found that exome mutation and DNA copy-number spectra in
              colorectal cancer cell lines closely resembled those seen in
              primary colorectal tumors. Similarities included the presence of
              two hypermutation phenotypes, as defined by signatures for
              defective DNA mismatch repair and DNA polymerase $\epsilon$

              in the broadly altered WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGF$\beta$, and p53

              involved in chromatin remodeling (ARID1A, CHD6, and SRCAP) and
              histone methylation or acetylation (ASH1L, EP300, EP400, MLL2,
              MLL3, PRDM2, and TRRAP). Chromosomal instability was prevalent in
              nonhypermutated cases, with similar patterns of chromosomal gains
              and losses. Although paired cell lines derived from the same
              tumor exhibited considerable mutation and DNA copy-number
              differences, in silico simulations suggest that these differences
              mainly reflected a preexisting heterogeneity in the tumor cells.

              also linked with less benefit when treated with anti-epidermal
              growth factor receptor antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer

              matter of particular interest in mCRC drug development. In
              contrast to other malignances such as BRAF mutant melanoma,
              efficacy observed with BRAF inhibitors in monotherapy in mCRC is
              poor. Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified

              surveys for driver mutations are challenged by an abundance of
              passenger mutations caused by carcinogenic UV light exposure. We
              developed a permutation-based framework to address this
              challenge, employing mutation data from intronic sequences to
              control for passenger mutational load on a per gene basis.
              Analysis of large-scale melanoma exome data by this approach
              discovered six novel melanoma genes (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1,
              STK19, and ARID2), three of which-RAC1, PPP6C, and STK19-harbored
              recurrent and potentially targetable mutations. Integration with
              chromosomal copy number data contextualized the landscape of
              driver mutations, providing oncogenic insights in BRAF- and
              NRAS-driven melanoma as well as those without known NRAS/BRAF
              mutations. The landscape also clarified a mutational basis for RB
              and p53 pathway deregulation in this malignancy. Finally, the
              spectrum of driver mutations provided unequivocal genomic
              evidence for a direct mutagenic role of UV light in melanoma

               increasingly performed, allowing systematic explorations of
               cancer dependencies at unprecedented accuracy and scale. One of
               the major computational challenges when analysing data derived
               from such screens is to identify genes that are essential for
               cell survival invariantly across tissues, conditions, and
               genomic-contexts (core-fitness genes), and to distinguish them
               from context-specific essential genes. This is of paramount
               importance to assess the safety profile of candidate therapeutic
               targets and for elucidating mechanisms involved in
               tissue-specific genetic diseases. RESULTS: We have developed
               CoRe: an R package implementing existing and novel methods for
               the identification of core-fitness genes (at two different level
               of stringency) from joint analyses of multiple CRISPR-Cas9
               screens. We demonstrate, through a fully reproducible
               benchmarking pipeline, that CoRe outperforms state-of-the-art
               tools, yielding more reliable and biologically relevant sets of
               core-fitness genes. CONCLUSIONS: CoRe offers a flexible
               pipeline, compatible with many pre-processing methods for the
               analysis of CRISPR data, which can be tailored onto different
               use-cases. The CoRe package can be used for the identification
               of high-confidence novel core-fitness genes, as well as a means

              cohort of patients who received prescription medication benefits
              through CVS Caremark, used a CVS Pharmacy ExtraCare Health Care
              (ECHC) loyalty card, and initiated a statin medication in 2011.
              OUTCOME: We evaluated associations between retail purchasing
              patterns and optimal adherence to statins in the 12 subsequent
              months. RESULTS: Among 11 010 statin initiators, 43\% were
              optimally adherent at 12 months of follow-up. Greater numbers of
              store visits per month and dollar amount per visit were
              positively associated with optimal adherence, as was making a
              purchase on the same day as filling a prescription (p<0.0001 for
              all). Models to predict adherence using retail purchase variables
              had low discriminative ability (C-statistic: 0.563), while models
              with both clinical and retail purchase variables achieved a
              C-statistic of 0.617. CONCLUSIONS: While the use of retail
              purchases may improve the discriminative ability of claims-based
              approaches, these data alone appear inadequate for adherence
              prediction, even with the addition of more complex analytical
              approaches. Nevertheless, associations between retail purchasing

              pharmacy claims are used to study drug use among the uninsured
              after drug policy changes, to prevent drug-drug interactions and
              duplication of therapy, and to guide medication therapy
              management. Claims include only prescriptions filled at 1
              pharmacy location or within 1 pharmacy chain and do not include
              prescriptions filled at outside pharmacies, potentially limiting
              research accuracy and pharmacy-based safety interventions.
              OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to assess elderly
              patients' pharmacy loyalty and to identify predictors of using
              multiple pharmacies. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the
              Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE)
              pharmacy benefit program with corresponding Medicare claims in
              the state of Pennsylvania comprised the study cohort. Among
              patients with pharmacy claims from all pharmacies used in
              2004-2005, a primary pharmacy was defined as the pharmacy where
              at least 50\% of a patient's prescriptions were filled. The
              number of pharmacies/chains used and prescriptions filled in 2005
              was calculated. Predictors of using multiple pharmacies in 2005
              were age, female gender, white race, urban residency,
              comorbidities, number of distinct chemical drugs (unique
              medications) used, and number of prescriptions filled, which were
              all assessed in 2004. RESULTS: In total, pharmacy claims data
              from 182,116 patients (147,718 women [81.1\%]; mean [SD] age,
              78.8 [7.1] years; 168,175 white [92.3\%]; 76,580 [42.1\%]
              residing in an urban zip code area) were included. Of the 182,116
              PACE patients in the study, a primary pharmacy was identified for
              180,751 patients (99.3\%). In 2005, patients filled an average of
              59.3 prescriptions, with 57.0 prescriptions (96.1\%) having been
              filled at the primary pharmacy. Compared with patients who used
              or=15 unique medications had a 2.66 times (95\% CI, 2.53-2.80)
              greater likelihood of using multiple pharmacies in 2005. Patients
              aged >or=85 years were 1.07 times (95\% CI, 1.04-1.11) as likely
              to use multiple pharmacies compared with patients aged 65 to 74
              years. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that patients aged >or=65
              years were loyal to their primary pharmacy, offering reassurance
              to researchers and pharmacists who use retail pharmacy claims
              data to evaluate and/or to improve safe and appropriate

               by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of
               innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of
               AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The
               theory specifies four intelligences required for service
               tasks?mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic?and lays
               out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for
               accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable
               order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical
               mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding
               empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job
               replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than
               the job level, and for ?lower? (easier for AI) intelligence
               tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job?s tasks, a
               transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to
               replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take
               over all of a job?s tasks. The progression of AI task
               replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in
               predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the
               intelligences for service employees. An important implication
               from our theory is that analytical skills will become less
               important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the
               ?softer? intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance
               for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of
               performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which
               enables innovative ways of human?machine integration for
               providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for

  abstract = "Pricing in the online world is highly transparent \& can be a
              primary driver for online purchase. While dynamic pricing is not
              new \& used by many to increase sales and margins, its benefit to
              online retailers is immense. The proposed study is a result of
              ongoing project that aims to develop a generic framework and
              applicable techniques by applying sound machine learning
              algorithms to enhance right price purchase (not cheapest price)
              by customers on e-commerce platform. This study focuses more on
              inventory led e-commerce companies, however the model can be
              extended to online marketplaces without inventories. Facilitated
              by statistical and machine learning models the study seeks to
              predict the purchase decisions based on adaptive or dynamic
              pricing of a product. Different data sources which capture visit
              attributes, visitor attributes, purchase history, web data, and
              context understanding, lays a strong foundation to this
              framework. The study focuses on customer segments for predicting
              purchase rather than on individual buyers. Personalization of
              adaptive pricing and purchase prediction will be the next logical
              extension of the study once the results for this are presented.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia have a
              large influence on health outcomes due to their chronic nature
              and serious complications. Medication is a key factor in
              preventing disease advancement, and it is important to assess
              whether good medication adherence has any potential long-term
              impact on health outcomes and provides an international
              validation on the relationship. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the
              impact of good medication adherence on health outcomes of
              complications and hospitalizations for hypertension,
              hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. METHODS: Patients who had had
              outpatient pharmacy claims for drugs for hypertension, diabetes,
              or hyperlipidemia were separately identified from the Korean
              National Health Insurance Claims Database in year 2009. A 10\%
              random sample was respectively drawn from the three disease
              groups, and all claims from years 2008-2011 were extracted for
              the sampled subjects. Medication adherence was measured by the
              medication possession ratio (MPR) during the 12-month after the
              index date, the initial date from when medication was counted,
              with poor adherence as <80\% of MPR. Health outcomes were
              measured both at 2 and 3 years after the index date as any
              occurrence of disease-related complications, disease-specific
              hospitalizations, and all-cause hospitalizations. RESULTS: Poor
              medication adherence was associated with a higher occurrence of
              disease-specific hospitalizations for hypertension patients
              (+10.9\%, only at 2 years). The likelihood of all-cause
              hospitalization was higher among patients who had poor medication
              adherence in hypertension (+32\% and +29\% at 2 and 3 years),
              hyperlipidemia (+16\% and +14\% at 2 and 3 years), and diabetes
              (+32\% and +29\% at 2 and 3 years). Poor medication adherence
              also increased the likelihood of complications for hypertension
              (+14\% and +7\% at 2 and 3 years) and hyperlipidemia patients
              (+8.1\% at 2 years). CONCLUSIONS: Targeting good medication

              evidence supports the role that pharmacists can play in improving
              diabetes medication use and outcomes. To improve the quality of
              care, the Veterans Health Administration has widely adopted care
              models that integrate clinical pharmacists, but more data are
              needed to interpret the impact of these services. Our objective
              was to assess clinical pharmacy services' impact on outcomes and
              oral antidiabetic medication (OAD) use among veterans with
              uncontrolled diabetes in the first year of therapy. METHODS: This
              was a retrospective cohort analysis using the Veterans Affairs
              (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse to identify the first diagnosis of
              and initiation of OAD therapy for uncomplicated, uncontrolled
              diabetes (A1C > 7.0\%) during 2002-2014. Receipt of clinical
              pharmacy services was identified using codes within VA electronic
              health records, and clinical values were obtained at or near the
              initial fill date and 365 days later. Use of OADs was assessed by
              proportion of days covered (PDC) for one year following the first
              filled prescription. Veterans having received clinical pharmacy
              services were matched 1:1 to those having not seen a clinical
              pharmacist in the first year of therapy, and generalized linear
              models assessed changes and differences in outcomes. RESULTS: The
              analysis included 5749 patients in each cohort. On average,
              patients saw a clinical pharmacist 2.5 times throughout the first
              year of OAD therapy. Adherence to OAD medications was higher in
              veterans having seen a pharmacist (84.3\% vs. 82.4\%, p < 0.0001)
              and more such patients achieved a PDC of at least 80\% (72.2\%
              vs. 68.2\%, p < 0.0001). After one year of OAD therapy, mean
              change in hemoglobin A1C was greater among those receiving
              pharmacy services (- 1.5\% vs. -1.4\%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION:

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The patient problem list is an important component of
              clinical medicine. The problem list enables decision support and
              quality measurement, and evidence suggests that patients with
              accurate and complete problem lists may have better outcomes.
              However, the problem list is often incomplete. OBJECTIVE: To
              determine whether association rule mining, a data mining
              technique, has utility for identifying associations between
              medications, laboratory results and problems. Such associations
              may be useful for identifying probable gaps in the problem list.
              DESIGN: Association rule mining was performed on structured
              electronic health record data for a sample of 100,000 patients
              receiving care at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.
              The dataset included 272,749 coded problems, 442,658 medications
              and 11,801,068 laboratory results. MEASUREMENTS: Candidate
              medication-problem and laboratory-problem associations were
              generated using support, confidence, chi square, interest, and
              conviction statistics. High-scoring candidate pairs were compared
              to a gold standard: the Lexi-Comp drug reference database for
              medications and Mosby's Diagnostic and Laboratory Test Reference
              for laboratory results. RESULTS: We were able to successfully
              identify a large number of clinically accurate associations. A
              high proportion of high-scoring associations were adjudged
              clinically accurate when evaluated against the gold standard
              (89.2\% for medications with the best-performing statistic, chi
              square, and 55.6\% for laboratory results using interest).
              CONCLUSION: Association rule mining appears to be a useful tool
              for identifying clinically accurate associations between

              have wide applications in biomedical discovery, such as disease
              mechanism understanding and drug discovery. The FDA Adverse Event
              Reporting System (FAERS) contains rich information about patient
              diseases, medications, drug adverse events and demographics of 17
              million case reports. Here, we explored this data resource to
              mine disease comorbidity relationships using association rule
              mining algorithm and constructed a disease comorbidity network.
              RESULTS: We constructed a disease comorbidity network with 1059
              disease nodes and 12,608 edges using association rule mining of
              FAERS (14,157 rules). We evaluated the performance of comorbidity
              mining from FAERS using known disease comorbidities of multiple
              sclerosis (MS), psoriasis and obesity that represent rare,
              moderate and common disease respectively. Comorbidities of MS,
              obesity and psoriasis obtained from our network achieved
              precisions of 58.6\%, 73.7\%, 56.2\% and recalls 87.5\%, 69.2\%

              disease comorbidity network with disease semantic network,
              disease genetic network and disease treatment network. We showed
              that (1) disease comorbidity clusters exhibit significantly
              higher semantic similarity than random network (0.18 vs 0.10);
              (2) disease comorbidity clusters share significantly more genes
              (0.46 vs 0.06); and (3) disease comorbidity clusters share
              significantly more drugs (0.64 vs 0.17). Finally, we demonstrated
              that the disease comorbidity network has potential in uncovering
              novel disease relationships using asthma as a case study.

              Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens for 250 cancer cell lines,

              chemotherapy. Functional genomics approaches offer a means to
              discover specific molecules mediating the aberrant growth and
              survival of cancer cells. Thus, using a loss-of-function RNA
              interference genomic screen, we identified the aberrant
              expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as a crucial element
              in AML pathogenesis. We found HGF expression leading to autocrine
              activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, MET, in nearly half
              of the AML cell lines and clinical samples we studied. Genetic
              depletion of HGF or MET potently inhibited the growth and
              survival of HGF-expressing AML cells. However, leukemic cells
              treated with the specific MET kinase inhibitor crizotinib
              developed resistance resulting from compensatory upregulation of
              HGF expression, leading to the restoration of MET signaling. In
              cases of AML where MET is coactivated with other tyrosine
              kinases, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1),
              concomitant inhibition of FGFR1 and MET blocked this compensatory
              HGF upregulation, resulting in sustained logarithmic cell killing
              both in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Our results show a
              widespread dependence of AML cells on autocrine activation of
              MET, as well as the key role of compensatory upregulation of HGF
              expression in maintaining leukemogenic signaling by this

              identify a set of small molecules inducing a desired phenotype
              from large small-molecule libraries. However, the resulting set

              thus little insight on the shared mechanism of action (MoA)
              underlying their efficacy can be gained. RESULTS: We introduce a
              computational method (Drug-Set Enrichment Analysis-DSEA) based on
              drug-induced gene expression profiles, which is able to identify
              the molecular pathways that are targeted by most of the drugs in
              the set. By diluting drug-specific effects unrelated to the
              phenotype of interest, DSEA is able to highlight
              phenotype-specific pathways, thus helping to formulate hypotheses
              on the MoA shared by the drugs in the set. We validated the
              method by analysing five different drug-sets related to
              well-known pharmacological classes. We then applied DSEA to

              mediated by altered expression of proteostasis genes. METHODS: To
              identify small molecules mimicking low temperature, we compared
              gene expression profiles of cells kept at 27°C with those
              previously generated from more than 1300 compounds. The resulting
              candidates were tested with a functional assay on a bronchial
              epithelial cell line. RESULTS: We found that anti-inflammatory
              glucocorticoids, such as mometasone, budesonide, and fluticasone,
              increased mutant CFTR function. However, this activity was not

              Our results suggest that rescue of F508del-CFTR by low

              individual rare diseases, combined with the time and capital
              requirements of pharmaceutical R\&D, have hindered the
              development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative
              is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be
              used to treat diseases different from their original indications.
              In order to generate drug repurposing hypotheses in a systematic
              and comprehensive fashion, it is essential to integrate
              information from across the literature of pharmacology, genetics,

              knowledge graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships

              time-consuming and high risk. Repurposing/repositioning of
              approved drugs offers a relatively low-cost and high-efficiency
              approach toward rapid development of efficacious treatments. The
              emergence of large-scale, heterogeneous biological networks has
              offered unprecedented opportunities for developing in silico drug
              repositioning approaches. However, capturing highly non-linear,
              heterogeneous network structures by most existing approaches for
              drug repositioning has been challenging. RESULTS: In this study,
              we developed a network-based deep-learning approach, termed
              deepDR, for in silico drug repurposing by integrating 10
              networks: one drug-disease, one drug-side-effect, one drug-target
              and seven drug-drug networks. Specifically, deepDR learns
              high-level features of drugs from the heterogeneous networks by a
              multi-modal deep autoencoder. Then the learned low-dimensional
              representation of drugs together with clinically reported
              drug-disease pairs are encoded and decoded collectively via a
              variational autoencoder to infer candidates for approved drugs
              for which they were not originally approved. We found that deepDR

              characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.908], outperforming conventional
              network-based or machine learning-based approaches. Importantly,
              deepDR-predicted drug-disease associations were validated by the

              amenable to pharmacologic modulation. However, the current
              anti-cancer therapeutic armamentarium continues to lag behind. As
              the cost of developing a new drug remains prohibitively
              expensive, repurposing of existing approved and investigational
              drugs is sought after given known safety profiles and reduction
              in the cost barrier. Notably, successes in oncologic drug
              repurposing have been infrequent. Computational in-silico
              strategies have been developed to aid in modeling biological
              processes to find new disease-relevant targets and discovering
              novel drug-target and drug-phenotype associations. Machine and
              deep learning methods have especially enabled leaps in those
              successes. This review will discuss these methods as they pertain
              to cancer biology as well as immunomodulation for drug
              repurposing opportunities in oncologic diseases.",

              Project and linked those to 12 therapeutic use categories derived

              expression and the scarcity of genomic data for many diseases are
              important limitations to such approaches. Here we focused on a

              FDA-approved compounds, not considering data concerning the
              diseases. We propose a novel computational approach to predict
              drug repositioning based on state-of-the-art machine-learning
              algorithms. We have integrated multiple layers of information: i)
              on the distances of the drugs based on how similar are their
              chemical structures, ii) on how close are their targets within
              the protein-protein interaction network, and iii) on how

              cancer therapeutics1. DNA repair processes represent attractive
              synthetic lethal targets, because many cancers exhibit an
              impairment of a DNA repair pathway, which can lead to dependence

              rise to synthetic lethal relationships, we queried dependencies
              in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), which results
              from deficient DNA mismatch repair. Here we analysed data from
              large-scale silencing screens using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout

              dispensable in models of cancers that are microsatellite stable.
              Depletion of WRN induced double-stranded DNA breaks and promoted
              apoptosis and cell cycle arrest selectively in MSI models. MSI
              cancer models required the helicase activity of WRN, but not its
              exonuclease activity. These findings show that WRN is a synthetic

              therapeutic strategies and promising clinical trials, the
              prognosis remains extremely poor, with a mean survival of less
              than 14 months. GBM aggressive behaviour is due to a
              subpopulation of tumourigenic stem-like cells, GBM stem cells
              (GSCs), which hierarchically drive onset, proliferation, and
              tumour recurrence. The morbidity and mortality of this disease
              strongly encourage exploring genetic characteristics of GSCs.
              Here, using array-CGH platform, we investigated genetic and
              genomic aberration profiles of GBM parent tumour (n = 10) and
              their primarily derived GSCs. Statistical analysis was performed
              by using R software and complex heatmap and corrplot packages.
              Pearson correlation and K-means algorithm were exploited to
              compare genetic alterations and to group similar genetic profiles

              9p21deletions, which are typical features of primary GBM,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Intra-tumor heterogeneity stems from genetic,
              epigenetic, functional, and environmental differences among tumor
              cells. A major source of genetic heterogeneity comes from DNA
              sequence differences and/or whole chromosome and focal copy
              number variations (CNVs). Whole chromosome CNVs are caused by
              chromosomal instability (CIN) that is defined by a persistently
              high rate of chromosome mis-segregation. Accordingly, CIN causes
              constantly changing karyotypes that result in extensive
              cell-to-cell genetic heterogeneity. How the genetic heterogeneity
              caused by CIN influences gene expression in individual cells
              remains unknown. METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing
              on a chromosomally unstable glioblastoma cancer stem cell (CSC)
              line and a control normal, diploid neural stem cell (NSC) line to
              investigate the impact of CNV due to CIN on gene expression. From
              the gene expression data, we computationally inferred large-scale
              CNVs in single cells. Also, we performed copy number adjusted
              differential gene expression analysis between NSCs and
              glioblastoma CSCs to identify copy number dependent and
              independent differentially expressed genes. RESULTS: Here, we
              demonstrate that gene expression across large genomic regions
              scales proportionally to whole chromosome copy number in
              chromosomally unstable CSCs. Also, we show that the differential
              expression of most genes between normal NSCs and glioblastoma
              CSCs is largely accounted for by copy number alterations.
              However, we identify 269 genes whose differential expression in
              glioblastoma CSCs relative to normal NSCs is independent of copy
              number. Moreover, a gene signature derived from the subset of
              genes that are differential expressed independent of copy number
              in glioblastoma CSCs correlates with tumor grade and is
              prognostic for patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results
              demonstrate that CIN is directly responsible for gene expression
              changes and contributes to both genetic and transcriptional
              heterogeneity among glioblastoma CSCs. These results also
              demonstrate that the expression of some genes is buffered against
              changes in copy number, thus preserving some consistency in gene
              expression levels from cell-to-cell despite the continuous change
              in karyotype driven by CIN. Importantly, a gene signature derived
              from the subset of genes whose expression is buffered against
              copy number alterations correlates with tumor grade and is
              prognostic for patient survival that could facilitate patient
              diagnosis and treatment.",

              Accumulating evidence has revealed a critical contribution by the

              understanding of the regulatory networks affected by Polycomb

              also limits tissue damage by increasing immunosuppressive
              cytokines and leukocytes and maintains tissue homeostasis by
              promoting tolerance to antigens derived from apoptotic cells.
              Thus, tumor cell efferocytosis following cytotoxic cancer
              treatment could impart tolerance to tumor cells evading
              treatment-induced apoptosis with deleterious consequences in
              tumor residual disease. We report here that efferocytosis cleared
              apoptotic tumor cells in residual disease of lapatinib-treated
              HER2+ mammary tumors in MMTV-Neu mice, increased
              immunosuppressive cytokines, myeloid-derived suppressor cells

              induced secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, but failed to
              prevent increased tumor MDSCs, Treg, and immunosuppressive
              cytokines. We found that efferocytosis stimulated expression of
              IFN-$\gamma$, which stimulated the expression of

              proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting
              cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing
              angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying
              these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the

              inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Network enrichment analysis is a powerful method,
              which allows to integrate gene enrichment analysis with the
              information on relationships between genes that is provided by
              gene networks. Existing tests for network enrichment analysis
              deal only with undirected networks, they can be computationally
              slow and are based on normality assumptions. RESULTS: We propose
              NEAT, a test for network enrichment analysis. The test is based
              on the hypergeometric distribution, which naturally arises as the
              null distribution in this context. NEAT can be applied not only
              to undirected, but to directed and partially directed networks as
              well. Our simulations indicate that NEAT is considerably faster
              than alternative resampling-based methods, and that its capacity
              to detect enrichments is at least as good as the one of
              alternative tests. We discuss applications of NEAT to network
              analyses in yeast by testing for enrichment of the Environmental
              Stress Response target gene set with GO Slim and KEGG functional
              gene sets, and also by inspecting associations between functional
              sets themselves. CONCLUSIONS: NEAT is a flexible and efficient
              test for network enrichment analysis that aims to overcome some
              limitations of existing resampling-based tests. The method is
              implemented in the R package neat, which can be freely downloaded

              has greatly expanded in the past decade. However, non-coding
              cancer driver mutations are less well-characterized and only a
              handful of recurrent non-coding mutations, most notably TERT
              promoter mutations, have been reported. Here, as part of the
              ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG)
              Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from
              2658 cancer across 38 tumor types, we perform multi-faceted
              pathway and network analyses of non-coding mutations across 2583
              whole cancer genomes from 27 tumor types compiled by the
              ICGC/TCGA PCAWG project that was motivated by the success of
              pathway and network analyses in prioritizing rare mutations in
              protein-coding genes. While few non-coding genomic elements are
              recurrently mutated in this cohort, we identify 93 genes
              harboring non-coding mutations that cluster into several modules
              of interacting proteins. Among these are promoter mutations
              associated with reduced mRNA expression in TP53, TLE4, and TCF4.
              We find that biological processes had variable proportions of
              coding and non-coding mutations, with chromatin remodeling and
              proliferation pathways altered primarily by coding mutations,
              while developmental pathways, including Wnt and Notch, altered by
              both coding and non-coding mutations. RNA splicing is primarily
              altered by non-coding mutations in this cohort, and samples
              containing non-coding mutations in well-known RNA splicing
              factors exhibit similar gene expression signatures as samples
              with coding mutations in these genes. These analyses contribute a
              new repertoire of possible cancer genes and mechanisms that are

              data is to distinguish functional ``driver mutations'' important
              for cancer development from random ``passenger mutations.'' A
              common approach for identifying driver mutations is to find genes
              that are mutated at significant frequency in a large cohort of
              cancer genomes. This approach is confounded by the observation
              that driver mutations target multiple cellular signaling and
              regulatory pathways. Thus, each cancer patient may exhibit a
              different combination of mutations that are sufficient to perturb
              these pathways. This mutational heterogeneity presents a problem
              for predicting driver mutations solely from their frequency of
              occurrence. We introduce two combinatorial properties, coverage
              and exclusivity, that distinguish driver pathways, or groups of
              genes containing driver mutations, from groups of genes with
              passenger mutations. We derive two algorithms, called Dendrix, to
              find driver pathways de novo from somatic mutation data. We apply
              Dendrix to analyze somatic mutation data from 623 genes in 188
              lung adenocarcinoma patients, 601 genes in 84 glioblastoma
              patients, and 238 known mutations in 1000 patients with various
              cancers. In all data sets, we find groups of genes that are

              occur in a limited number of pathways, and alterations that
              affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient.
              While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer
              genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is
              incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have
              developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer
              (MEMo). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical
              tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member
              genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2)
              member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the
              same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the
              modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA), the method identifies the principal known
              altered modules in glioblastoma (GBM) and highlights the striking
              mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in the PI(3)K, p53, and
              Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel
              observation that inactivation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is mutually
              exclusive of amplification of CCNE1 and inactivation of RB1,
              suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability in
              this cancer type; and, we identify RBBP8 as a candidate oncogene
              involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any

              mutations that drive cancer development are distributed across a
              large number of genes. This mutational heterogeneity complicates
              efforts to distinguish functional mutations from sporadic,
              passenger mutations. Since cancer mutations are hypothesized to
              target a relatively small number of cellular signaling and
              regulatory pathways, a common practice is to assess whether known
              pathways are enriched for mutated genes. We introduce an
              alternative approach that examines mutated genes in the context
              of a genome-scale gene interaction network. We present a
              computationally efficient strategy for de novo identification of
              subnetworks in an interaction network that are mutated in a
              statistically significant number of patients. This framework
              includes two major components. First, we use a diffusion process
              on the interaction network to define a local neighborhood of
              ``influence'' for each mutated gene in the network. Second, we

              informed by the use of biological interaction networks. For
              example, protein-protein interaction networks have been used to
              analyze gene expression data, to prioritize germline variants,
              and to identify somatic driver mutations in cancer. In these and
              other applications, the underlying computational problem is to
              identify altered subnetworks containing genes that are both
              highly altered in an 'omics dataset and are topologically close
              (e.g. connected) on an interaction network. Results: We introduce
              Hierarchical HotNet, an algorithm that finds a hierarchy of
              altered subnetworks. Hierarchical HotNet assesses the statistical
              significance of the resulting subnetworks over a range of
              biological scales and explicitly controls for ascertainment bias
              in the network. We evaluate the performance of Hierarchical
              HotNet and several other algorithms that identify altered

              significantly mutated subnetworks. On somatic mutation data from
              The Cancer Genome Atlas, Hierarchical HotNet outperforms other

              nevertheless exhibit common function in their network context as
              measured by similarity of relationships with neighboring

              exhibit very similar function, independent of relationships with
              other genes. The proposed technique explicitly relaxes this
              assumption by employing the comparison of relational profiles.
              For example, two genes which always activate a third gene are

              cell lines, we compared 60 melanoma cell lines profiled by the
              Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and 472 cutaneous melanoma tumors

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Although cell lines are an essential resource for
              studying cancer biology, many are of unknown ancestral origin,
              and their use may not be optimal for evaluating the biology of
              all patient populations. METHODS: An admixture analysis was
              performed using genome-wide chip data from the Catalogue of
              Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) Cell Lines Project to
              calculate genetic ancestry estimates for 1018 cancer cell lines.
              After stratifying the analyses by tissue and histology types,
              linear models were used to evaluate the influence of ancestry on
              gene expression and somatic mutation frequency. RESULTS: For the
              701 cell lines with unreported ancestry, 215 were of East Asian
              origin, 30 were of African or African American origin, and 453
              were of European origin. Notable imbalances were observed in
              ancestral representation across tissue type, with the majority of
              analyzed tissue types having few cell lines of African American
              ancestral origin, and with Hispanic and South Asian ancestry
              being almost entirely absent across all cell lines. In evaluating
              gene expression across these cell lines, expression levels of the
              genes neurobeachin line 1 (NBEAL1), solute carrier family 6
              member 19 (SLC6A19), HEAT repeat containing 6 (HEATR6), and
              epithelial cell transforming 2 like (ECT2L) were associated with
              ancestry. Significant differences were also observed in the
              proportions of somatic mutation types across cell lines with
              varying ancestral proportions. CONCLUSIONS: By estimating genetic
              ancestry for 1018 cancer cell lines, the authors have produced a
              resource that cancer researchers can use to ensure that their
              cell lines are ancestrally representative of the populations they
              intend to affect. Furthermore, the novel ancestry-specific signal
              identified underscores the importance of ancestral awareness when

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the advancement of computational
              approaches and abundance of biomedical data, a broad range of
              neurodegenerative disease models have been developed. In this
              review, we argue that computational models can be both relevant
              and useful in neurodegenerative disease research and although the
              current established models have limitations in clinical practice,
              artificial intelligence has the potential to overcome
              deficiencies encountered by these models, which in turn can
              improve our understanding of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: In recent
              years, diverse computational approaches have been used to shed
              light on different aspects of neurodegenerative disease models.
              For example, linear and nonlinear mixed models, self-modeling
              regression, differential equation models, and event-based models
              have been applied to provide a better understanding of disease
              progression patterns and biomarker trajectories. Additionally,
              the Cox-regression technique, Bayesian network models, and
              deep-learning-based approaches have been used to predict the
              probability of future incidence of disease, whereas nonnegative
              matrix factorization, nonhierarchical cluster analysis,
              hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and deep-learning-based
              approaches have been employed to stratify patients based on their
              disease subtypes. Furthermore, the interpretation of
              neurodegenerative disease data is possible through
              knowledge-based models which use prior knowledge to complement
              data-driven analyses. These knowledge-based models can include
              pathway-centric approaches to establish pathways perturbed in a
              given condition, as well as disease-specific knowledge maps,
              which elucidate the mechanisms involved in a given disease.
              Collectively, these established models have revealed high
              granular details and insights into neurodegenerative disease
              models. SUMMARY: In conjunction with increasingly advanced
              computational approaches, a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative
              disease models, which can be broadly categorized into data-driven
              and knowledge-driven, have been developed. We review the state of
              the art data and knowledge-driven models and discuss the
              necessary steps which are vital to bring them into clinical
              application.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Synthetic lethality (SL) refers to the genetic
              interaction between two or more genes where only their
              co-alteration (e.g. by mutations, amplifications or deletions)
              results in cell death. In recent years, SL has emerged as an
              attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: by targeting the
              SL partners of altered genes in cancer cells, these cells can be
              selectively killed while sparing the normal cells. Consequently,
              a number of studies have attempted prediction of SL interactions
              in human, a majority by extrapolating SL interactions inferred
              through large-scale screens in model organisms. However, these
              predicted SL interactions either do not hold in human cells or do
              not include genes that are (frequently) altered in human cancers,
              and are therefore not attractive in the context of cancer
              therapy. RESULTS: Here, we develop a computational approach to
              infer SL interactions directly from frequently altered genes in
              human cancers. It is based on the observation that pairs of genes
              that are altered in a (significantly) mutually exclusive manner
              in cancers are likely to constitute lethal combinations. Using
              genomic copy-number and gene-expression data from four cancers,
              breast, prostate, ovarian and uterine (total 3980 samples) from
              The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identify 718 genes that are
              frequently amplified or upregulated, and are likely to be
              synthetic lethal with six key DNA-damage response (DDR) genes in
              these cancers. By comparing with published data on gene
              essentiality (~16000 genes) from ten DDR-deficient cancer cell
              lines, we show that our identified genes are enriched among the
              top quartile of essential genes in these cell lines, implying
              that our inferred genes are highly likely to be (synthetic)
              lethal upon knockdown in these cell lines. Among the inferred
              targets are tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2) and the deubiquitinating
              enzyme ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 7 (USP7) whose
              overexpression correlates with poor survival in cancers.
              CONCLUSION: Mutual exclusivity between frequently occurring
              genetic events identifies synthetic lethal combinations in
              cancers. These identified genes are essential in cell lines, and
              are potential candidates for targeted cancer therapy.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Early application of second-generation sequencing
              technologies to transcript quantitation (RNA-seq) has hinted at a
              vast mammalian transcriptome, including transcripts from nearly
              all known genes, which might be fully measured only by ultradeep
              sequencing. Subsequent studies suggested that low-abundance
              transcripts might be the result of technical or biological noise
              rather than active transcripts; moreover, most RNA-seq
              experiments did not provide enough read depth to generate
              high-confidence estimates of gene expression for low-abundance
              transcripts. As a result, the community adopted several
              heuristics for RNA-seq analysis, most notably an arbitrary
              expression threshold of 0.3 - 1 FPKM for downstream analysis.
              However, advances in RNA-seq library preparation, sequencing
              technology, and informatic analysis have addressed many of the
              systemic sources of uncertainty and undermined the assumptions
              that drove the adoption of these heuristics. We provide an
              updated view of the accuracy and efficiency of RNA-seq
              experiments, using genomic data from large-scale studies like the
              ENCODE project to provide orthogonal information against which to
              validate our conclusions. RESULTS: We show that a human cell's
              transcriptome can be divided into active genes carrying out the
              work of the cell and other genes that are likely the by-products
              of biological or experimental noise. We use ENCODE data on
              chromatin state to show that ultralow-expression genes are
              predominantly associated with repressed chromatin; we provide a
              novel normalization metric, zFPKM, that identifies the threshold
              between active and background gene expression; and we show that
              this threshold is robust to experimental and analytical
              variations. CONCLUSIONS: The zFPKM normalization method
              accurately separates the biologically relevant genes in a cell,
              which are associated with active promoters, from the
              ultralow-expression noisy genes that have repressed promoters. A
              read depth of twenty to thirty million mapped reads allows
              high-confidence quantitation of genes expressed at this
              threshold, providing important guidance for the design of RNA-seq
              studies of gene expression. Moreover, we offer an example for
              using extensive ENCODE chromatin state information to validate
              RNA-seq analysis pipelines.",

              efficient cancer detection methods and therapeutic approaches.
              One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all
              the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the
              1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily.
              Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in
              tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations
              across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from
              neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals
              of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed
              bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in
              the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach
              combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of
              mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the

              such an approach to obtain the compendium of mutational cancer

              tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points
              towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of
              this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour

               from 342 cancer cell lines and other published data sets shows
               that CERES decreases false-positive results and provides
               consistent estimates of sgRNA activity. The CRISPR--Cas9 system
               has revolutionized gene editing both at single genes and in
               multiplexed loss-of-function screens, thus enabling precise
               genome-scale identification of genes essential for proliferation

               reported that a gene-independent antiproliferative effect of
               Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage confounds such measurement of genetic

               However, the mechanisms explaining oncogene addiction remain

               this model, which we call ``oncogenic shock,'' prosurvival
               signals dissipate quickly on oncoprotein inactivation whereas
               proapoptotic signals linger sufficiently long to commit the cell
               to an apoptotic death. This mechanism may contribute to the

              mesenchymal cells transformed with either the EWS-FLI1 or
              FUS-CHOP rearrangement displayed similar sensitivities to
              olaparib, whereas the Ewing's sarcoma cell line SK-N-MC had
              increased olaparib sensitivity. In the original study, mouse
              mesenchymal cells transformed with the EWS-FLI1 rearrangement and
              SK-N-MC cells were found to have similar sensitivities to
              olaparib, whereas mesenchymal cells transformed with the FUS-CHOP
              rearrangement displayed a reduced sensitivity to olaparib (Figure
              4E; Garnett et al., 2012). We also studied another Ewing's
              sarcoma cell line, A673: A673 cells depleted of EWS-FLI1 or a
              negative control both displayed similar sensitivities to
              olaparib, whereas the original study reported a decreased
              sensitivity to olaparib when EWS-FLI1 was depleted (Figure 4F;
              Garnett et al., 2012). Differences between the original study and
              this replication attempt, such as the use of different sarcoma
              cell lines and level of knockdown efficiency, are factors that
              might have influenced the outcomes. Finally, where possible, we

               perturbation-response signatures by utilizing a diverse
               collection of perturbations across many model systems and assay

               signatures also enables the newly implemented signature search
               functionality, which utilizes the iLINCS platform to identify
               conditions that mimic or reverse gene set queries. A newly

              needed. To that end, we analyzed gene expression profiles from
              1,290 CRC tumors using consensus-based unsupervised clustering.
              The resultant clusters were then associated with therapeutic
              response data to the epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted
              drug cetuximab in 80 patients. The results of these studies
              define six clinically relevant CRC subtypes. Each subtype shares
              similarities to distinct cell types within the normal colon crypt
              and shows differing degrees of 'stemness' and Wnt signaling.
              Subtype-specific gene signatures are proposed to identify these
              subtypes. Three subtypes have markedly better disease-free
              survival (DFS) after surgical resection, suggesting these
              patients might be spared from the adverse effects of chemotherapy

              intermediate DFS, associate with improved response to the
              chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI in adjuvant or metastatic settings.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cancer researchers use cell lines, patient-derived
              xenografts, engineered mice, and tumoroids as models to
              investigate tumor biology and to identify therapies. The
              generalizability and power of a model derive from the fidelity
              with which it represents the tumor type under investigation;
              however, the extent to which this is true is often unclear. The
              preponderance of models and the ability to readily generate new
              ones has created a demand for tools that can measure the extent
              and ways in which cancer models resemble or diverge from native
              tumors. METHODS: We developed a machine learning-based
              computational tool, CancerCellNet, that measures the similarity
              of cancer models to 22 naturally occurring tumor types and 36
              subtypes, in a platform and species agnostic manner. We applied
              this tool to 657 cancer cell lines, 415 patient-derived
              xenografts, 26 distinct genetically engineered mouse models, and
              131 tumoroids. We validated CancerCellNet by application to
              independent data, and we tested several predictions with
              immunofluorescence. RESULTS: We have documented the cancer models
              with the greatest transcriptional fidelity to natural tumors, we
              have identified cancers underserved by adequate models, and we
              have found models with annotations that do not match their
              classification. By comparing models across modalities, we report
              that, on average, genetically engineered mice and tumoroids have
              higher transcriptional fidelity than patient-derived xenografts
              and cell lines in four out of five tumor types. However, several
              patient-derived xenografts and tumoroids have classification
              scores that are on par with native tumors, highlighting both
              their potential as faithful model classes and their
              heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: CancerCellNet enables the rapid
              assessment of transcriptional fidelity of tumor models. We have
              made CancerCellNet available as a freely downloadable R package (

              lines by other lines has been recognized and documented back to
              the 1950s. Based on submissions to major cell repositories in the
              last decade, it is estimated that between 18\% and 36\% of cell

              has the opportunity to alter in vitro, may not be representative.
              Yet without the overall architecture used in histopathological
              diagnosis of fresh samples, reclassification of cell lines has
              been difficult. Gene-expression profiling accurately reproduces
              histopathological classification and is readily applicable to
              cell lines. Here, we compare the gene-expression profiles of 41
              cell lines with 44 tumors from lung cancer. These profiles were
              generated after hybridization of samples to four replicate
              7,685-element cDNA microarrays. After removal of genes that were
              uniformly up- or down-regulated in fresh compared with cell-line
              samples, cluster analysis produced four major branch groups.
              Within these major branches, fresh tumor samples essentially

               biomedical research in the world. However, it remains uncertain
               whether genomic alterations existing in primary tumor tissues
               are represented in cell lines and whether cell lines carry cell
               line-specific genomic alterations. This study was performed to
               answer these questions. METHODS: Array-based comparative genomic
               hybridization (CGH) was employed with 4030 bacterial artificial
               chromosomes (BACs) that cover the genome at 1.0 megabase
               resolution to analyze DNA copy number aberrations (DCNAs) in 35
               primary breast tumors and 24 breast cancer cell lines. DCNAs
               were compared between these two groups. A tissue microdissection
               technique was applied to primary tumor tissues to reduce the
               contamination of samples by normal tissue components. RESULTS:
               The average number of BAC clones with DCNAs was 1832 (45.3\% of
               spotted clones) and 971 (24.9\%) for cell lines and primary
               tumor tissues, respectively. Gains of 1q and 8q and losses of
               8p, 11q, 16q and 17p were detected in >50\% of primary cancer
               tissues. These aberrations were also frequently detected in cell
               lines. In addition to these alterations, the cell lines showed
               recurrent genomic alterations including gains of 5p14-15, 20q11
               and 20q13 and losses of 4p13-p16, 18q12, 18q21, Xq21.1 and
               Xq26-q28 that were barely detected in tumor tissue specimens.
               These are considered to be cell line-specific DCNAs. The
               frequency of the HER2 amplification was high in both cell lines
               and tumor tissues, but it was statistically different between
               cell lines and primary tumors (P = 0.012); 41.3 +/- 29.9\% for
               the cell lines and 15.9 +/- 18.6\% for the tissue specimens.
               CONCLUSIONS: Established cell lines carry cell lines-specific
               DCNAs together with recurrent aberrations detected in primary
               tumor tissues. It must therefore be emphasized that cell lines
               do not always represent the genotypes of parental tumor tissues.",

              fresh tissue by carrying out a meta-analysis of array-based
              comparative genomic hybridization data that considers both copy
              number alteration frequencies and the occurrence of cancer gene
              amplifications and homozygous deletions. Pairwise correlation
              comparisons between the data sets of seven diagnosis-specific
              matched tumor and cell line groups indicate that the trends in
              aberration frequencies are highly correlated between tumors and
              cell line sets of matched cancer histology relative to unmatched
              pairings. Despite their similarities, cell lines showed uniformly
              higher locus-specific alteration frequencies (P = 0.004) and
              several recurring cell line-specific alterations emerged. These
              include the previously documented losses of 13q and 9p and gains

              tumors and it is therefore important to learn more about the
              frequency and distribution of Notch mutations in a tumor context.
              METHODS: In this report, we use data from the recently developed
              Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia to assess the frequency and
              distribution of Notch mutations in a large panel of cancer cell
              lines in silico. RESULTS: Our results show that the mutation
              frequency of Notch receptor and ligand genes is at par with that
              for established oncogenes and higher than for a set of
              house-keeping genes. Mutations were found across all four Notch
              receptor genes, but with notable differences between protein
              domains, mutations were for example more prevalent in the regions
              encoding the LNR and PEST domains in the Notch intracellular
              domain. Furthermore, an in silico estimation of functional impact
              showed that deleterious mutations cluster to the ligand-binding
              and the intracellular domains of NOTCH1. For most cell line
              groups, the mutation frequency of Notch genes is higher than in
              associated primary tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results shed new
              light on the spectrum of Notch mutations after in vitro culturing
              of tumor cells. The higher mutation frequency in tumor cell lines
              indicates that Notch mutations are associated with a growth
              advantage in vitro, and thus may be considered to be driver
              mutations in a tumor cell line context.",

              protein profiling of 34 cell lines, including (i) targeted deep
              sequencing (n = 612 genes) to detect single nucleotide variants
              and insertions/deletions; (ii) high resolution DNA copy number
              profiling; (iii) gene expression profiling at exon resolution;
              (iv) small RNA expression profiling by deep sequencing; and (v)
              protein expression analysis (n = 297 proteins) by reverse phase
              protein microarrays. RESULTS: The cell lines were stratified
              according to the key molecular subtypes of CRC and data were
              integrated at two or more levels by computational analyses. We
              confirm that the frequencies and patterns of DNA aberrations are
              associated with genomic instability phenotypes and that the cell
              lines recapitulate the genomic profiles of primary carcinomas.
              Intrinsic expression subgroups are distinct from genomic
              subtypes, but consistent at the gene-, microRNA- and
              protein-level and dominated by two distinct clusters; colon-like
              cell lines characterized by expression of gastro-intestinal
              differentiation markers and undifferentiated cell lines showing
              upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and TGF$\beta$
              signatures. This sample split was concordant with the gene
              expression-based consensus molecular subtypes of primary tumors.
              Approximately ¼ of the genes had consistent regulation at the DNA
              copy number and gene expression level, while expression of
              gene-protein pairs in general was strongly correlated. Consistent
              high-level DNA copy number amplification and outlier gene- and
              protein- expression was found for several oncogenes in individual
              cell lines, including MYC and ERBB2. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              expands the view of CRC cell lines as accurate molecular models

              Bayesian Analysis of Gene Essentiality (BAGEL) algorithm for
              accurate classification of gene essentiality from short hairpin
              RNA and CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide genetic screens. RESULTS: We
              introduce an updated version, BAGEL2, which employs an improved
              model that offers a greater dynamic range of Bayes Factors,
              enabling detection of tumor suppressor genes; a multi-target
              correction that reduces false positives from off-target CRISPR
              guide RNA; and the implementation of a cross-validation strategy
              that improves performance ~ 10$\times$ over the prior bootstrap
              resampling approach. We also describe a metric for screen quality
              at the replicate level and demonstrate how different algorithms
              handle lower quality data in substantially different ways.
              CONCLUSIONS: BAGEL2 substantially improves the sensitivity,
              specificity, and performance over BAGEL and establishes the new
              state of the art in the analysis of CRISPR knockout fitness
              screens. BAGEL2 is written in Python 3 and source code, along
              with all supporting files, are available on github (

              in gRNA design, as well as availability of gRNA effect
              measurements, to reduce the number of gRNAs per gene. We designed
              a human genome-wide library that has effective size of 30,000
              constructs, yet targets each gene with three gRNAs. Our minimized

              prognosis for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease.
              Ewing's sarcoma cells are acutely hypersensitive to poly
              (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and this is being
              evaluated in clinical trials, although the mechanism of
              hypersensitivity has not been directly addressed. PARP inhibitors
              have efficacy in tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations, which confer
              deficiency in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous
              recombination (HR). This drives dependence on PARP1/2 due to
              their function in DNA single-strand break (SSB) repair. PARP
              inhibitors are also cytotoxic through inhibiting PARP1/2
              auto-PARylation, blocking PARP1/2 release from substrate DNA.
              Here, we show that PARP inhibitor sensitivity in Ewing's sarcoma
              cells is not through an apparent defect in DNA repair by HR, but
              through hypersensitivity to trapped PARP1-DNA complexes. This
              drives accumulation of DNA damage during replication, ultimately
              leading to apoptosis. We also show that the activity of PARP
              inhibitors is potentiated by temozolomide in Ewing's sarcoma
              cells and is associated with enhanced trapping of PARP1-DNA
              complexes. Furthermore, through mining of large-scale drug

              particular sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma cells to the inhibition
              of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). This review updates the
              reader on PARP function, the development of PARP inhibitors
              (PARPi) and the evidence for targeting PARP in Ewing sarcoma. It
              concludes with a description of ongoing/emerging PARPi clinical
              trials in patients with Ewing sarcoma. RECENT FINDINGS: PARP has
              a major role in DNA repair, and is a transcription regulator. The
              oncoprotein in Ewing sarcoma, EWS-FLI1, is proposed to interact
              with PARP-1, driving PARP-1 expression, which further promotes
              transcriptional activation by EWS-FLI1. Thus, there are two
              rationales for PARPi in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma: to
              disrupt the interaction between EWS-FLI1 and PARP, and for
              chemo-potentiation or radio-potentiation. The first clinical
              trial with a single agent PARPi failed to show significant
              responses, but preclinical evidence for combinations of PARPi
              with chemotherapy or radiotherapy is very promising. SUMMARY:
              Despite initial excitement for the potential of PARPi as single
              agent therapy in Ewing sarcoma, the emerging preclinical data now

               cancer cell progression and metastasis. The reciprocal
               cell-cell/ECM interaction and tumor cell hijacking of
               non-malignant cells force stromal cells to lose their function
               and acquire new phenotypes that promote development and invasion
               of tumor cells. Understanding the underlying cellular and
               molecular mechanisms governing these interactions can be used as
               a novel strategy to indirectly disrupt cancer cell interplay and
               contribute to the development of efficient and safe therapeutic
               strategies to fight cancer. Furthermore, the tumor-derived
               circulating materials can also be used as cancer diagnostic
               tools to precisely predict and monitor the outcome of therapy.

               knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of
               the disease have emerged as potential refinements. Herein, the
               prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted

               nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic

               first proposed. It postulates that - despite the diverse array
               of genetic lesions typical of cancer - some tumours rely on one
               single dominant oncogene for growth and survival, so that
               inhibition of this specific oncogene is sufficient to halt the
               neoplastic phenotype. A large amount of evidence has proven the
               pervasive power of this notion, both in basic research and in
               therapeutic applications. However, in the face of such a

               magnitude of beneficial effect as trastuzumab. This targeted
               agent (monoclonal antibody) is associated with a significant
               improvement in both disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS)
               in women with HER-2 positive breast cancer when given in
               combination with or in sequence to adjuvant chemotherapy. This
               has been confirmed in a recent Cochrane meta-analysis of
               randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including 6 adjuvant and 2
               neoadjuvant studies (NSABP B-31, NCCTG N9831, BCIRG 006, HERA,
               FinHer, PACS-04, Buzdar and NOAH), with data collection until
               February 2010. Overall, mortality is reduced by one-third and
               the risk of relapse by 40\%. Concerns regarding cardiac
               dysfunction are declining, with reports indicating its
               reversibility in most instances, however truly long term cardiac
               evaluation is still lacking. Hence, the benefit of trastuzumab
               could be challenged by cardiac toxicity, in lower-risk patients
               [T1a,b node-negative (N0) tumors] or those with increased
               cardiovascular risk (older women and patients with previous
               significant heart disease/suboptimal left ventricular ejection
               fraction [LVEF (<55\%)], all of whom were largely excluded from
               the aforementioned adjuvant RCTs. These patient subgroups might
               warrant a specific approach, such as anti-HER2 treatment
               combined with just a taxane (avoiding anthracyclines) or with
               endocrine therapy. Reasonably large phase II trials aimed at
               exploring these more individualized regimens are underway in the
               US. The optimal duration of trastuzumab therapy remains unknown
               since the selection of the one year duration in the pivotal
               trials was arbitrary. The HERA trial showed that prolonging
               trastuzumab administration to two years does not confer
               additional advantage over one year. The PHARE trial compared 6
               versus 12 months of trastuzumab and failed to show
               non-inferiority of the shorter treatment administration. At the
               present time, one year of adjuvant trastuzumab remains the
               standard-of-care until results from SOLD, Short-HER and
               PERSEPHONE consolidate or negate this finding. The route of
               trastuzumab administration has also been recently challenged. A
               subcutaneous formulation is being evaluated in several studies.
               The HannaH phase III trial compared the subcutaneous (SC) to the
               intravenous (IV) formulation of trastuzumab. The former was
               proven non-inferior to the latter, although the incidence of
               serious adverse events was slightly higher in the SC arm. The
               authors concluded that SC trastuzumab, administered at a fixed
               dose of 600mg over 5min, is a valid alternative option, with the

               the interim analysis by an independent data and safety
               monitoring board, crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was
               recommended. Response rates were 48\% for vemurafenib and 5\%
               for dacarbazine. Common adverse events associated with
               vemurafenib were arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia,
               keratoacanthoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity,
               nausea, and diarrhea; 38\% of patients required dose
               modification because of toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Vemurafenib
               produced improved rates of overall and progression-free survival

               Since imatinib, the first TKI for anti-cancer therapy, was

               and do not develop early onset tumours. Here, we show that PARP

               inhibitors, presumably because resultant collapsed replication

               is likely to be highly tumour specific, because only the tumours

               chromosome 2 to fuse with the NPM gene on chromosome 5. ALK +
               ALCL respond to cytotoxic drugs, but relapses occur and bear a
               poor prognosis(Stein, Foss et al. Blood 96 3681-95 2000;
               Ferreri, Govi et al. Crit Rev Oncol Hematol 83 293-302 2012).
               ALK-positive large B-cell lymphoma (ALK+ LBCL) is a rare
               lymphoma with a most frequent t(2;17)(p23;q23) translocation
               responsible for Clathrin-ALK fusion protein(Swerdlow, Campo et
               al. 2 2008). Crizotinib is the first ALK inhibitor which entered
               clinical practice: it is an orally bioavailable small-molecule
               inhibitor active on the ALK and MET receptor tyrosine kinases.
               While the activity of crizotinib in ALK+ lung cancer is
               documented (Kwak, Bang et al. N Engl J Med 363 1693-703 2010)no
               report on long term effects of crizotinib in ALK+ lymphomas
               exists; impressive short-term therapeutic activity was reported
               in two patients (Gambacorti-Passerini, Messa et al. N Engl J Med
               364 775-6 2011), but no long-term data are available. In the
               present study, crizotinib was administered (250 mg BID) as
               monotherapy to 11 ALK+ lymphoma patients, diagnosed with ALK+
               Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) by immunohistochemistry and FISH.
               Nine patients had a ALCL histology while the remaining 2 were
               DLBCL Patients had a refractory or relapsed disease after at
               least one prior chemotherapy regimen and measurable disease. All
               had involvement at multiple sites (nodal and extranodal) as well
               as B symptoms and an ECOG performance score of 1-4. Response to
               therapy was assessed according to RECIST criteria (Therasse,
               Arbuck et al. J Natl Cancer Inst 92 205-16 2000) The Overall
               Response Rate (ORR) was 10/11 (91\%, 95\% CI: 60-99\%) and
               included 9 CR (82\%, 95\% CI: 51-96\%) and 1 PR. Evidence of
               response by PET/CAT scan was present as early as 12 days. B
               symptoms disappeared promptly and LDH levels normalized within
               30 days after the start of crizotinib. Disease status at the
               latest follow-up (June 2013) is as follows: 4 patients are in CR
               under continuous crizotinib treatment; they also test negative
               by RT-PCR for NPM/ALK (Mussolin, Damm-Welk et al. Leukemia 27
               416-22 2012). Three patients (2 with LBCL and 1 with ALCL) died
               due to disease progression; 1 patient obtained CR, relapsed
               after 2 months of treatment and is now in CR on continued
               brentuximab treatment (month 29); 1 patient obtained CR on
               crizotinib and after 2 months stopped treatment, received an
               alloBMT and is still in CR; 2 patients treated for relapses post
               alloBMT obtained CR and are still in CR but they stopped
               crizotinib after 8-10 months. The two patients with ALK+ LBCL
               died within 3 months; in those with ALCL the CR rate was 9/9
               (100\%, 95\% CI, 74-100\%) with a median duration of 10 months
               (range 2-37). The 3 years PFS and OS rates are 62\% (95\% CI,
               35-85\%) and 73\% (95\% CI, 40-93\%) respectively, with a
               plateau in the curve after the initial 6 months. In two relapsed
               patients the kinase domain of NPM-ALK could be amplified from
               peripheral blood samples obtained at the time of relapse (month
               5 and 2). Deep sequencing of these products revealed the
               presence of different mutations: Q1064R at high prevalence
               (95\%,) in patient (pt) \#2 and I1171N (33\%) plus M1328I (14\%)
               in pt \#6. All these mutations were not present in samples
               obtained before crizotinib treatment. I1171N was already
               discovered in an in-vitro screening (Ceccon, Mologni et al. Mol
               Cancer Res 11 122-32 2012): it commands an intermediate level of
               resistance to crizotinib (RI: 5.8) which however is cross
               resistant with other anti-ALK TKI such as AP26113 and
               NVP-TAE684. The other two mutations were not previously
               described: they present a RI to crizotinib of 2.4 (M1328I) and
               8.5 (Q1064R). Since these residues do not form direct contacts
               with crizotinib, they probably interact with different
               structures within the catalytic domain such as the hydrophobic
               R-spine (I1171N) (Ceccon, Mologni et al. Mol Cancer Res 11
               122-32 2012), the activation loop (M1328I), or yet unidentified
               regions (Q1064R). In conclusion, these positive results extend
               our initial observation on two patients (Gambacorti-Passerini,
               Messa et al. N Engl J Med 364 775-6 2011) and provide long-term
               follow up data. Crizotinib exerted a potent antitumor activity
               in advanced ALK+ lymphoma and produced durable responses in this
               population of heavily pre-treated patients, with a benign safety
               profile. Disclosures: Gambacorti-Passerini: Pfizer: Consultancy,

  abstract = "The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has long been known to play a major
              role in the growth and survival of cancer cells. Breast tumors
              often harbor PIK3CA gene alterations, which therefore constitute
              a rational drug target. However, it has taken many years to
              demonstrate clinically-relevant efficacy of PI3K inhibition and
              eventually attain regulatory approvals. As data on PI3K
              inhibitors continue to mature, this review updates and summarizes
              the current state of the science, including the prognostic role
              of PIK3CA alterations in breast cancer; the evolution of PI3K
              inhibitors; the clinical utility of the first-in-class oral
              selective PI3K$\alpha$ inhibitor, alpelisib; PIK3CA mutation
              detection techniques; and adverse effect management.
              PIK3CA-mutated breast carcinomas predict survival benefit from
              PI3K inhibitor therapy. The pan-PI3K inhibitor, buparlisib and
              the beta-isoform-sparing PI3K inhibitor, taselisib, met efficacy
              endpoints in clinical trials, but pictilisib did not; moreover,
              poor tolerability of these three drugs abrogated further clinical
              trials. Alpelisib is better tolerated, with a more manageable
              toxicity profile; the principal adverse events, hyperglycemia,
              rash and diarrhea, can be mitigated by intensive monitoring and
              timely intervention, thereby enabling patients to remain adherent
              to clinically beneficial treatment. Alpelisib plus endocrine
              therapy shows promising efficacy for treating postmenopausal
              women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. Available evidence
              supporting using alpelisib after disease progression on
              first-line endocrine therapy with or without CDK4/6 inhibitors
              justifies PIK3CA mutation testing upon diagnosing HR+/HER2-
              advanced breast cancer, which can be done using either tumor
              tissue or circulating tumor DNA. With appropriate toxicity
              management and patient selection using validated testing methods,

               powerful method to detect even weak associations between
               variants and phenotypes; however, many of the identified
               associated variants are in non-coding regions, and presumably
               influence gene expression regulation. Identifying potential drug
               targets, i.e. causal protein-coding genes, therefore, requires
               crossing the genetics results with functional data. RESULTS: We
               present a novel data integration pipeline that analyses GWAS
               results in the light of experimental epigenetic and
               cis-regulatory datasets, such as ChIP-Seq, Promoter-Capture Hi-C
               or eQTL, and presents them in a single report, which can be used

               inhibitors cause an increase in DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs),
               which are converted during replication to irreparable toxic DNA
               double-strand breaks (DSBs) in BRCA1/2 defective cells. There

               to explain the synthetic lethality between BRCA1/2 and PARP

               PARP-1 to be trapped onto DNA repair intermediates, especially
               during base excision repair. This may in turn cause obstruction
               to replication forks, which require BRCA-dependent homologous

               synergistic drug pairs and biomarkers. 160 teams participated to

              hundreds of cell lines has identified genes whose disruption
              leads to fitness defects, a critical step in identifying
              candidate cancer targets. However, the number of essential genes
              detected from these monogenic knockout screens is low compared to
              the number of constitutively expressed genes in a cell. RESULTS:
              Through a systematic analysis of screen data in cancer cell lines
              generated by the Cancer Dependency Map, we observe that half of
              all constitutively expressed genes are never detected in any
              CRISPR screen and that these never-essentials are highly enriched
              for paralogs. We investigated functional buffering among
              approximately 400 candidate paralog pairs using CRISPR/enCas12a
              dual-gene knockout screening in three cell lines. We observe 24
              synthetic lethal paralog pairs that have escaped detection by
              monogenic knockout screens at stringent thresholds. Nineteen of
              24 (79\%) synthetic lethal interactions are present in at least
              two out of three cell lines and 14 of 24 (58\%) are present in

               is by enrichment analysis of signature genes in e.g.

                 offers an information-rich measure of cell state that can
                 provide a more detailed account of cellular responses to

               The range of antitumor activity seen preclinically and in
               patients highlights the importance of identifying determinants
               of response to this drug. In large tumor cell panels of diverse

               absolute correlation with mutational or phospho-protein markers
               of BRAF/MEK, RAS, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity.
               We aimed to enhance predictivity by measuring pathway output
               through coregulated gene networks displaying differential mRNA
               expression exclusive to resistant cell subsets and correlated to
               mutational or dynamic pathway activity. We discovered an 18-gene

               independent of tumor genotype. Where the MEK pathway is
               activated but the cells remain resistant to selumetinib, we
               identified a 13-gene signature that implicates the existence of
               compensatory signaling from RAS effectors other than PI3K. The
               ability of these signatures to stratify samples according to
               functional activation of MEK and/or selumetinib sensitivity was

               microenvironment. This is true for many cancer treatments,
               including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). While it is
               well-established that ICIs promote T cell activation, their
               broader impact on other intratumoral immune cells is unclear;
               this information is needed to identify new mechanisms of action
               and improve ICI efficacy. Many preclinical studies have begun
               using single-cell analysis to delineate therapeutic responses in
               individual immune cell types within tumors. One major limitation
               to this approach is that therapeutic mechanisms identified in
               preclinical models have failed to fully translate to human
               disease, restraining efforts to improve ICI efficacy in
               translational research. METHOD: We previously developed a
               computational transfer learning approach called projectR to
               identify shared biology between independent high-throughput
               single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. In the present
               study, we test this algorithm's ability to identify conserved
               and clinically relevant transcriptional changes in complex tumor
               scRNA-seq data and expand its application to the comparison of
               scRNA-seq datasets with additional data types such as bulk
               RNA-seq and mass cytometry. RESULTS: We found a conserved
               signature of NK cell activation in anti-CTLA-4 responsive mouse
               and human tumors. In human metastatic melanoma, we found that
               the NK cell activation signature associates with longer overall
               survival and is predictive of anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) response.
               Additional molecular approaches to confirm the computational
               findings demonstrated that human NK cells express CTLA-4 and
               bind anti-CTLA-4 antibodies independent of the antibody binding
               receptor (FcR) and that similar to T cells, CTLA-4 expression by
               NK cells is modified by cytokine-mediated and target
               cell-mediated NK cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: These data

               training samples to predict cancer types unseen during the
               training. We hypothesize the existence of a set of type-agnostic

               accepts a pair of query and support samples (gene expression
               profiles) and learns the representation of similar or dissimilar
               cancer types through two parallel convolutional neural networks

               CancerSiamese for cancer type prediction for primary and
               metastatic tumors using samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas
               (TCGA) and MET500. Network transfer learning was utilized to
               facilitate the training of the CancerSiamese models.
               CancerSiamese was tested for different N-way predictions and
               yielded an average accuracy improvement of 8\% and 4\% over the
               benchmark 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) classifier for primary and

               Functional analysis of these marker genes revealed several

               requires identifying regulatory relationships between

               often shared across biological processes, cell-types, and
               organisms. Leveraging multiple sources of information, such as
               publicly available gene expression datasets, could therefore be
               helpful when learning a network of interest. Integrating data
               across different studies, however, raises numerous technical
               concerns. Hence, a common approach in network inference, and
               broadly in genomics research, is to separately learn models from
               each dataset and combine the results. Individual models,
               however, often suffer from under-sampling, poor generalization
               and limited network recovery. In this study, we explore previous
               integration strategies, such as batch-correction and model
               ensembles, and introduce a new multitask learning approach for
               joint network inference across several datasets. Our method
               initially estimates the activities of transcription factors, and
               subsequently, infers the relevant network topology. As

               coefficients as a combination of both dataset-specific and
               conserved components. In addition, adaptive penalties may be
               used to favor models that include interactions derived from
               multiple sources of prior knowledge including orthogonal
               genomics experiments. We evaluate generalization and network
               recovery using examples from Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces

               biological data often hinders the design of an appropriate
               predictive model. In this regard, large scale pharmacogenomics
               studies, like CCLE and GDSC hold the promise to mitigate the
               issue. However, one cannot directly employ data from multiple
               sources together due to the existing distribution shift in data.
               One way to solve this problem is to utilize the transfer
               learning methodologies tailored to fit in this specific context.
               RESULTS: In this paper, we present two novel approaches for
               incorporating information from a secondary database for
               improving the prediction in a target database. The first
               approach is based on latent variable cost optimization and the
               second approach considers polynomial mapping between the two
               databases. Utilizing CCLE and GDSC databases, we illustrate that
               the proposed approaches accomplish a better prediction of drug
               sensitivities for different scenarios as compared to the
               existing approaches. CONCLUSION: We have compared the
               performance of the proposed predictive models with
               database-specific individual models as well as existing transfer
               learning approaches. We note that our proposed approaches
               exhibit superior performance compared to the abovementioned
               alternative techniques for predicting sensitivity for different
               anti-cancer compounds, particularly the nonlinear mapping model

               and functionality to perform inference on these networks.
               Adaptation of such platforms for open-source academic

               networks helps us to understand the underlying mechanism of
               complex cellular processes and responses. METHOD: This paper
               describes a causal inference approach for constructing
               transcriptional regulatory networks using gene expression data,
               promoter sequences and information on transcription factor (TF)
               binding sites. The method first identifies active TFs in each
               individual experiment using a feature selection approach. TFs
               are viewed as ``treatments'' and gene expression levels as
               ``responses''. For every TF and gene pair, a marginal structural
               model is built to estimate the causal effect of the TF on the
               expression level of the gene. The model parameters can be
               estimated using the G-computation procedure or the IPTW

               each of these models is used to measure how strongly a TF

               is one of the primary goals of systems biology. In this context
               identification of sub-networks connecting sets of seed proteins
               or seed genes plays a crucial role. Given that no natural node
               and edge weighting scheme is available retrieval of a minimum
               size sub-graph leads to the classical Steiner tree problem,
               which is known to be NP-complete. Many approximate solutions
               have been published and theoretically analyzed in the computer
               science literature, but far less is known about their practical
               performance in the bioinformatics field. RESULTS: Here we
               conducted a systematic simulation study of four different
               approximate and one exact algorithms on a large human
               protein-protein interaction network with ~14,000 nodes and
               ~400,000 edges. Moreover, we devised an own algorithm to
               retrieve a sub-graph of merged Steiner trees. The application of
               our algorithms was demonstrated for two breast cancer signatures

               to accurate solutions, while at the same time being several
               orders of magnitude faster than the exact approach. Our devised

               plasma-cell disorder. In this study, we aimed at dissecting the
               functional impact on transcriptome of gene mutations,
               copy-number abnormalities (CNA), and chromosomal rearrangements
               (CR). Moreover, we applied a geno-transcriptomic approach to
               identify specific biomarkers for personalized treatments.
               EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed 514 newly diagnosed patients
               from the IA12 release of the CoMMpass study, accounting for
               mutations in multiple myeloma driver genes, structural variants,
               copy-number segments, and raw-transcript counts. We performed an
               in silico drug sensitivity screen (DSS), interrogating the
               Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) dataset after anchoring cell
               lines to primary tumor samples using the Celligner algorithm.
               RESULTS: Immunoglobulin translocations, hyperdiploidy and
               chr(1q)gain/amps were associated with the highest number of
               deregulated genes. Other CNAs and specific gene mutations had a
               lower but very distinct impact affecting specific pathways. Many
               recurrent genes showed a hotspot (HS)-specific effect. The
               clinical relevance of double-hit multiple myeloma found strong
               biological bases in our analysis. Biallelic deletions of tumor
               suppressors and chr(1q)-amplifications showed the greatest
               impact on gene expression, deregulating pathways related to cell
               cycle, proliferation, and expression of immunotherapy targets.
               Moreover, our in silico DSS showed that not only t(11;14) but
               also chr(1q)gain/amps and CYLD inactivation predicted
               differential expression of transcripts of the BCL2 axis and
               response to venetoclax. CONCLUSIONS: The multiple myeloma
               genomic architecture and transcriptome have a strict connection,
               led by CNAs and CRs. Gene mutations impacted especially with
               HS-mutations of oncogenes and biallelic tumor suppressor gene
               inactivation. Finally, a comprehensive geno-transcriptomic

              However, current catalogues of cancer drivers are mostly based on
              indirect measurements of mutation frequencies, positions or
              types, rather than their effect on clonal expansions in vivo .
              Moreover, non-genetic drivers are largely unknown, as are the
              epigenetic and transcriptomic effects of genetic drivers. Here we
              perform spatial computational inference on multiomic data with
              matched whole-genome sequencing, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. Using 436
              samples, we directly quantify the contribution, or lack thereof,
              of putative driver genes to subclonal expansions in vivo in 30
              colorectal carcinomas (4-33 samples per patient, median=15).
              Although subclonal neutral evolution was widespread (13/26 cases
              with sufficient data), there were cases with clear evidence of
              subclonal selection (6/26) in which we measured epigenetic and
              transcriptomic differences between subclones in vivo . In 7/26
              cases we could not distinguish between neutral or selective
              evolution with the available data. We identified expanding
              subclones that were not driven by known genetic alterations, and
              propose candidate epigenetic drivers. We identified the
              distinguishing patterns of genomic heterogeneity produced in
              fast, exponentially growing tumours (7/26) versus neoplasms

              clonally intermixed (16/28 cases with sufficient data) versus

              receptor-mediated endocytosis, with the low-density lipoprotein

              LRRK2, as well as acute inhibition of its kinase activity,

              Kinase-activating mutations in LRRK2 are a cause of Parkinson's

               with specific patient features, including right-sided primary
               tumor location, peritoneal and non-regional lymph node
               involvement, and poor prognosis. In approximately 30\% of cases,
               a simultaneous mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite
               instability-high (MSI-H) phenotype is identified. The prognostic
               impact of the BRAF mutation appears to be less marked in
               patients with MSI-H CRC than in patients with microsatellite
               stable (MSS) tumor. The treatment of BRAFV600-mutated CRC is
               still a challenge for the clinicians, mainly due to the poor
               survival outcomes obtained with traditional chemotherapy
               regimens. In recent years, two novel treatment strategies have
               offered remarkable changes in the treatment of this specific

              high-resolution Venn and Euler diagrams in the R statistical
              environment. To fill this gap we introduce VennDiagram, an R
              package that enables the automated generation of
              highly-customizable, high-resolution Venn diagrams with up to
              four sets and Euler diagrams with up to three sets. RESULTS: The
              VennDiagram package offers the user the ability to customize
              essentially all aspects of the generated diagrams, including font
              sizes, label styles and locations, and the overall rotation of
              the diagram. We have implemented scaled Venn and Euler diagrams,

               various genetically encoded perturbations are introduced into

               are evaluated by sequencing-based counting of the guide RNAs
               that specify each perturbation. The typical results of such
               screens are ranked lists of genes that confer sensitivity or
               resistance to the biological challenge of interest. Contributing
               to the broad utility of CRISPR screens, adaptations of the core
               CRISPR technology make it possible to activate, silence or
               otherwise manipulate the target genes. Moreover, high-content

  abstract = "Importance: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
              cause of cancer mortality worldwide with more than 1.85 million
              cases and 850 000 deaths annually. Of new colorectal cancer
              diagnoses, 20\% of patients have metastatic disease at
              presentation and another 25\% who present with localized disease
              will later develop metastases. Observations: Colorectal cancer is
              the third most common cause of cancer mortality for men and women
              in the United States, with 53 200 deaths projected in 2020. Among
              people diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer, approximately
              70\% to 75\% of patients survive beyond 1 year, 30\% to 35\%
              beyond 3 years, and fewer than 20\% beyond 5 years from
              diagnosis. The primary treatment for unresectable metastatic CRC
              is systemic therapy (cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic therapy
              such as antibodies to cellular growth factors, immunotherapy, and
              their combinations.) Clinical trials completed in the past 5
              years have demonstrated that tailoring treatment to the molecular
              and pathologic features of the tumor improves overall survival.
              Genomic profiling to detect somatic variants is important because
              it identifies the treatments that may be effective. For the 50\%
              of patients with metastatic CRC with KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wild-type
              tumors, cetuximab and panitumumab (monoclonal antibodies to the
              epithelial growth factor receptor [EGFR]), in combination with
              chemotherapy, can extend median survival by 2 to 4 months
              compared with chemotherapy alone. However, for the 35\% to 40\%
              of patients with KRAS or NRAS sequence variations (formerly
              termed mutations), effective targeted therapies are not yet
              available. For the 5\% to 10\% with BRAF V600E sequence
              variations, targeted combination therapy with BRAF and EGFR
              inhibitors extended overall survival to 9.3 months, compared to
              5.9 months for those receiving standard chemotherapy. For the 5\%
              with microsatellite instability (the presence of numerous
              insertions or deletions at repetitive DNA units) or mismatch
              repair deficiency, immunotherapy may be used in the first or
              subsequent line and has improved treatment outcomes with a median
              overall survival of 31.4 months in previously treated patients.
              Conclusions and Relevance: Advances in molecular profiling of
              metastatic CRC facilitate the ability to direct treatments to the
              biologic features of the tumor for specific patient subsets.
              Although cures remain uncommon, more patients can anticipate
              extended survival. Genomic profiling allows treatment selection
              so that more patients derive benefit and fewer are exposed to
              toxicity from ineffective therapies.",
